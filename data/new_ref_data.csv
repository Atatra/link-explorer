intense, action-packed opening, which features young characters navigating dangerous situations in a gritty undercity. They are impressed by the animation, raw style, and strong music that perfectly complements the tone of the show. Characters like Powder (who may evolve into Jinx) and Vander are introduced with complex personalities, and the world-building between the upper and lower city adds depth to the narrative. The music and sound design, with their atmospheric and layered qualities, significantly enhance the viewing experience. The episode ends with high stakes, leaving the viewers eager to see more, appreciating the show's blend of intense action, character development, and storytelling."
She-Hulk Peter Pan and Wendy the rings of power Captain Marvel The Last Jedi Mulan all products featuring a female lead of significant strength or power all brutally panned by audiences why is that sexism right or maybe it's just bad character writing that's not to Discount the awfulness of any actual hatred of female characters due to their gender but it's quite apparent once you think about it that such hateful commentary only finds any significant audience if the wider less spiteful viewing public dislikes the character for their own more sensible reasons the main reason of course is that so many lead women in film and TV in the past decade are just horribly written there are plenty of exceptions of course and we'll talk about a few of those this is a problem most notable in Disney projects as you could tell from my list but since Disney owns half the world at this point it feels like a wider issue so what exactly makes these characters such bad examples of what a protagonist should be well it's hard to point to any one thing in particular particular not all the characters discussed here will share the same writing flaws they all fail in varying ways but they do have some similarities a common one is being overpowered and not really earning that power the original animated film shows mulan's struggle due to her inexperience and lack of physical prowess but she makes up for those disadvantages by using her wits thinking creatively and refusing to quit even when things seem hopeless the new Mulan is basically a superhero already due to her midichlorians and thus is automatically more skilled than everyone else there's no need for her to use her brain or develop new ways to approach problems leaving the character flat and uninteresting it's worth noting that when I say earning power that doesn't necessarily mean doing something Noble or virtuous that results in the character being given great power as is the case with someone like Captain America most superheroes do not earn their abilities in such a way their powers are forced upon them through chance or freak accident and that's fine however to then earn the power given them the hero should have to struggle in some way to grow into his or her abilities the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie is a classic example of this Peter Parker is given superpowers through a random spider bite but he doesn't instantly know what to do with his Newfound abilities nor even how to put them to proper use there are significant Growing Pains as he learns to be the hero he now must become a more recent example of this Trope that was done fairly well is Kate Bishop from the Hawkeye show that at least 20 people watched despite being an incredibly talented Archer and martial artist from the get-go Kate is woefully inexperienced in the world of crime fighting and has to learn how to apply her skills in each new situation relying on the mentorship of Hawkeye himself on the flip side we have characters like She-Hulk and Rey Sky patine Rey's progression through her Jedi training was basically just whatever the plot required at any given moment Jen Walters woke up as She-Hulk and immediately was in full control of her Alter Ego the central struggles that defined the characters from whom these heroin ones were derived are just Stripped Away and not replaced by anything meaningful Jen's defining character moment takes place during a group therapy session when she comes to the realization that she needs to accept that she doesn't need to be She-Hulk to find acceptance that's right the Apex of Jen's character Arc is her deciding that she can be herself this wasn't an issue by the way until after the She-Hulk Persona was present prior to her accident Jen appeared to be quite satisfied with her life for some unknown reason she only decided to get into the dating scene after spending some time as a giant green monster and then found out apparently there is no market for a reasonably attractive 30-something year old lawyer in Los Angeles I don't know about you but to me that feels a bit contrived look I'm not in the online dating scene but I have it on good authority that women tend to get significantly more attention than men do on those apps especially if they happen to be successful and not ugly does this show seriously expect me to believe that the only guy is willing to even talk to Jen Walters are total creeps and losers or alternatively men who are only charming and friendly because they have an agenda speaking of which let's talk about Disney's obsession with promoting and elevating women it's one thing to have female characters who are smart strong persistent and courageous it's quite another to Simply promote the power of women by setting them up on a pedestal that kind of treatment is nothing more than pandering and stories that contain it suffer greatly take for example the recent Peter Pan and Wendy which decided that the all-male cast of Lost Boys wasn't inclusive enough and so tossed some girls into the mix girls can be rough and tumble too you hear uh do you know why the lost boys were originally all boys it's because they fell out of their prams or strollers for you Americans and were carted off to Neverland and girls are far too clever to do such a stupid thing but apparently no one involved in the casting decision had ever read the original novel so here we are or we could talk about Captain Marvel and the thinly veiled metaphor for the patriarchy embodied in the one dude who keeps telling her to not use her true power because that's cheating or whatever and of course She-Hulk seems to be mostly made just to complain about the pig-headedness of men so I'll check over there I'm gonna go talk to it yeah nobody talks like that it should come as no surprise that these shows and movies don't just fail at writing good female characters they're terribly written across the board I'm the Spy what it's not just Rey that the audience dislikes no characters from the Disney Trilogy won the hearts of the audience remember how great of a character Nick Fury was in Captain Marvel yeah neither does anyone else elrond really stood out in the rings of power right okay he actually wasn't terrible he wasn't good but he could have been worse honestly Galadriel could have been worse too not that I think she was well written she wasn't and her introduction in the first episode is basically a how-to course on Annoying audiences we first meet her as she's being tormented by other elf children for having the audacity to think that her origami swan will float not only does this display a severe lack of understanding of what elves are in tolkien's legendarium on the writer's part it demonstrates a cheap trick that modern media likes to use in order to attempt to make the audience like a character forced sympathy the Mantra goes something like this look this character is being mistreated you must then feel bad for her and like her the correct response to that is of course why is this character being mistreated for all we know Galadriel was being a complete twerp just moments before this scene and is totally deserving of having her boat sunk there's no narrative reason that the show gives for collateral to be tormented here it's just an attempt at manipulating the audience into feeling bad for the poor helpless victim and thus hopefully liking her contrast that with Arcane in the plight of Vin and powder the show opens with an actually tragic scene and it doesn't stoop to the pointed Petty tactics of rings of power Galadriel lives in valinor a place of transcendent peace and Harmony so the writers contrived in inane attempt at sympathy Arcane is set largely in a brutal slum of a city but it gives its main character a Plucky Relentless attitude that rejects the victimhood status which so many other are modern properties confer upon their heroines because if you're a victim how can anyone hate you well it's pretty easy when you're incredibly smug and don't give a rat's ass about the safety of your troops the me against the world vibes from Galadriel in the first episode are just so tired and overdone we know she's going to be right about Sauron still being around because of course she is she can take down the ice troll single-handedly because of course she can however that on its own would not necessarily be bad writing Galadriel because that is what the show calls her is quite old and thus an experienced Warrior I am willing to accept that this character has spent centuries in combat and thus is highly skilled and capable of such Feats what makes this scene so absurd is that all the other elves around her these Warriors hand-picked to exterminate Sauron and the remnants of his armies are completely and totally hapless and helpless to the point that they might as well be a different species than their leader it's totally fine to have protagonists who are supremely skilled but it's a really poor choice to have the supporting characters be complete buffoons in order to Showcase that skill Galadriel might as well just be out there on her own really most of the examples I've listed tend to just do things solo it is up to them and them alone to win the day as in Captain Marvel and Mulan all they really need to do is seize the power that is already within them to throw off the shackles others would impose upon them and victory is theirs the dramatic shift between victimhood and total power is what these movies believe to be meaningful character work but it's really just a violent swing from one extreme to the other and neither end of the spectrum is healthy there's a huge difference between having agency and being World conquering forces of nature that only needed to shrug off the hands holding them down if you're going to write the hero of a story a central character who ultimately is able to conquer the evil he or she faces you need to make them earn it that protagonist needs to struggle or even suffer as they obtain the strength necessary to win the day ideally they would find such strength through meaningful relationships or by learning from those wiser or more experienced than them recent examples of this done at least fairly well Rita vertaski a supremely skilled Soldier having to work together with Tom Cruise's character whose name I forget to gradually establish a plan to win the war by being motivated by love for her sister relying on others in her fight badly missing the guidance of her father figure Kate Bishop being mentored by Hawkeye as she realizes how ill-prepared she is for the world she has stumbled into there are plenty of other examples of female protagonists who match that description but I wanted to point out some from within the last decade to emphasize the point that audiences do not by and large just hate any strong woman on screen right now just the ones whose character arcs are flatter than the state of Kansas characters who need only achieve self-actualization are not only boring and lack meaningful character work they teach us awful lessons the idea that all that is needed for success is to seize the strength and power already within you is a harm powerful notion that discredits the value of relationships personal growth and humility you are sufficient these stories tell their audiences you don't need to change our heroes are supposed to inspire us either by their ability to grow beyond their own flaws and failures or despite being Paragons of virtue and goodness still having to struggle against overwhelming odds and having to use their wits to be creative to trust their team to win the day indeed some of the most admirable characters in fiction ones who do not suffer all that much personal growth due to having already attained great virtue find themselves insufficient this is most clear in tolkien's work where characters such as faramir Theoden and Aragorn Great Men Who suffer little if any inner turmoil at least in the books are not able to win the day but rather can only play their part in the war that will Define the future of Middle Earth they teach us the message we need to hear the message that Disney and Hollywood want to keep from our ears that is is you are not enough but you still can do great things they may not bring you glory they may even bring you pain and suffering but if you put the good of others before your own needs and wants you will find true and Lasting happiness so many modern heroines fail to win the love of the audience because they take shortcuts to power they are elevated by the story rather than having to climb up their own character Arc they are shallow character molds created largely to prove a point or push an agenda and perhaps most importantly they tend to care for themselves their own success their own ideas of what it means to be fulfilled Hollywood and Disney in particular seem to want so badly to provide us with examples of powerful women but they fail to understand what makes for a good example or role model the heroines they prop up are too often shallow unlikable and exhibit many of the traits such as arrogance and abrasiveness that their creators find abhorrent and male protagonists how is this fixed simple create characters to tell a story not to prove a point either show flawed characters who have to grow and change to heal their inner wounds and overcome their shortcomings or give us Paragons of virtue who have to struggle sacrifice and suffer due to the evil they face but most importantly write characters whose defining moments do not come as they realize their own worth and value that they themselves are sufficient but rather as they decide to take selfless action for the good of others I can't carry it for you but I can't carry you well those are all my rambling thoughts on the matter I hope we see lots more characters like by Kim Wexler Rita vertaski and Evelyn from The Quiet Place movies I just realized two of those characters are played by Emily Blunt no surprise they are,"The video critiques modern female protagonists, particularly in Disney projects, arguing they are often overpowered and lack meaningful character development. Characters like She-Hulk, Rey, and Mulan are criticized for not earning their power, making their arcs feel shallow. The video contrasts these with well-written female characters like Kate Bishop, Rita Vrtaski, and Evelyn, who face struggles, rely on others, and grow throughout their stories. The main issue is that modern media often elevates characters for the sake of an agenda, rather than through organic, earned development. The video advocates for creating characters with flaws and growth rather than simply promoting them as 'strong.'"
this is jinx pretty evil right well what if I told you she's actually not the bad person everyone sees her as now before you call me insane let's rewind for a moment before the chaos before the name Jinx there was just powder a scared wide-eyed girl trying to navigate the harsh realities of the world around her picture this she's growing up in zhan a city where survival isn't guaranteed and danger is always lurking just around the corner and then tragedy strikes her parents gone killed during the brutal piltover zon conflict in an instant her entire sense of safety is ripped away she's left clinging to her older sister Vai and a scrappy group of Misfits she calls family but here's where heartbreak truly begins powder desperate to prove her worth tries to help during a critical moment instead her invention a bomb she thought would save her family family ends in catastrophe an explosion devastating and final and just like that her found family is gone gone because of her this wasn't the calculated Act of a villain this was the tragic gut-wrenching mistake of a child who only wanted to help imagine being powder in that moment the crushing realization that your best effort to save the people you love has backfired in possibly the worst way that kind of guilt that kind of self-blame is not something you just carry it literally shapes you it Corps how you see the world and how you see yourself now this moment this devastating explosion became the foundation for everything that followed but that's just the start to really understand her story we need to dig even deeper what happens when you lose everything and then find yourself completely alone after that fateful explosion Jinx was left completely alone the world she knew had crumbled and the one person she trusted Above All Else VI was gone no goodbye no explanation just gone imagine that for a moment that one constant in your life disappears without a trace for jinx this wasn't just abandonment it was like the last piece of her fragile Foundation had been ripped away left to fend for herself in a brutal and unforgiving World Jinx spiraled self-doubt began to consume her was I the problem did I drive her away and that doubt quickly turned into anger and confusion she was desperate for answers but all she got was silence but that wasn't the worst of it her mind began to turn on her the explosion the Betrayal the loneliness it all created this storm of guilt and grief one that really never left her she began hearing the voices of her past her memories twisting into haunting hallucinations it's like her trauma created an endless loop replaying her worst mistakes over and over again and these hallucinations they're not just background noise they taunt her mock her they remind her of every failure every moment she thinks she's let someone down how could anyone think clearly under that kind of weight so when Jinx lashes out when her actions seem Reckless or even cruel it's not because she wants to hurt anyone it's because she's desperately trying to Shield herself she's building walls pushing people away doing whatever it takes to protect what little is left of her heart it's heartbreaking really her world is chaos because she's fighting the chaos inside of her and when you look at it that way it's hard not to see her as the victim of her circumstances rather than a villain but there's more to her story because while her struggles are undeniably tragic they also lead us to the question are her actions really as evil as they seem now let's talk about jinx's actions on the surface it's easy to label them as pure chaos right explosions destruction unpredictable Behavior it all screams villain but if you dig deeper you'll see there's something more to her story take a step back and ask yourself why does she do what she does her motives aren't rooted in evil they're rooted in fear and Desperation think about this everything she's ever car about has either been ripped away from her or Twisted beyond recognition she's terrified of losing what little she has left so when Jinx creates destruction it's not random it's her way of holding on to memories to relationships to her own fractured sense of reality one of the most powerful examples of this is in the dinner scene picture it Jinx sets the table bringing together VI Silko and even Caitlyn not to assert dominance but to find Clarity she's not playing the villain here she's desperately trying to figure out who she can trust but her emotions are so overwhelming so tangled that chaos becomes the only language she knows how to speak her behavior in that moment it's heartbreaking the people she loves are at odds and she's caught in the middle drowning in betrayal and insecurity her actions seem erratic sure but they're not coming from a place of malice they're coming from a place of pain and isn't that what makes her so compelling Jinx isn't trying to destroy the world she's trying to survive in it to piece together a life that makes sense when nothing around her does her explosions her attacks they're not about harming others they're about protecting herself from being hurt again so is she a villain or is she someone just trying to navigate a broken world the only way she knows how as we look closer that line becomes blurrier and blurrier it's so tempting isn't it to point to jinx and say that's the villain after all she leaves a trail of Destruction wherever she goes buildings crumble lives are lost and Chaos seems to follow her like a shadow but stop for a second and ask yourself are her actions really so different from everyone else fighting to survive in a world like Zan think about it the piltover enforcers the km Barons and even Vai they all make choices that lead to violence and destruction but because they have a badge a mission or a justifiable cause we're quick to rationalize their actions Jinx though she's labeled as Reckless dangerous evil but what if we flip that perspective what if her so-called chaos is simply her way of coping with a broken system A system that failed her at every turn her explosions they're not random their cries for control in a life that's been anything but stable her attacks their desperate attempts to protect herself from being hurt again sure her methods are extreme but they're not born out of malice they're rooted in fear pain and a desire to matter in a world that constantly dismisses her and here's the kicker if you really take a step back and see the world through her eyes the line between hero and villain doesn't just blur it practically disappears what's left is a young woman fighting to survive in the only way she knows how and that's not evil that's human now that we've seen how jinx's chaos isn't as black and white as it seemed let's dive deeper into the emotional core of her story because the real tragedy isn't the destruction she causes it's in what she lost along the way jinx's story isn't one of Pure Evil it's the story of a child shaped by a series of events so devastating so relentless that they broke her in ways the world refused to mend it's about trauma that fested in isolation a soul who didn't choose destruction but was led there by a series of betrayals and heart breaks from the loss of her parents to the shattering guilt of her accident Jinx has been fighting battles no one truly sees but here's the thing when you look closely her chaos isn't random it's not senseless it's a desperate cry for understanding for connection for someone to prove to her that she's not alone think of every time she lashes out like I've said it's not because she enjoys it it's because it's all she knows how to do when the world feels like it's slipping away from her again and maybe that's the most tragic part of all her story didn't have to go this way if someone anyone had stepped in to truly understand her to give her the space and support to heal who knows what she would have become maybe instead of jinx we'd be talking about powder the brilliant Fearless girl who only wanted to belong maybe the real tragedy of jinx isn't the destruction she causes it's that no one ever gave her the chance to heal and that I think is something worth thinking about who else in this world in our world is being left behind in the same way so what's your take do you see jinx as a misunderstood Soul shaped by her pain or something else entirely let's start a conversation drop your thoughts in the comments below I'd love to hear your perspective on her journey and hey if you enjoyed unpacking jinx's story make sure to like this video it really helps the channel grow also don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell so you won't miss out on our next Deep dive into complex fascinating characters just like Jinx thank you for watching and until next time stay curious,"The video reexamines Jinx from Arcane, arguing that she's not purely evil but a misunderstood character shaped by trauma. Initially, she was Powder, a girl trying to navigate a harsh world, whose tragic mistake during an attempt to save her family left her guilt-ridden and alone. As Jinx, she spirals into chaos, but her actions are driven by fear and desperation, not malice. Her explosions and reckless behavior are cries for control and connection, reflecting her struggle to cope with a broken system and past betrayals. The video challenges the notion of her as a villain, suggesting that her true tragedy lies in her lack of support and the missed opportunity for healing."
imagine having to give up everything you ever wanted just to save everyone else only for your crush who you gave up so much for to blow herself up Jinx X Echo is called time bomb and after that blast

here with copium yes Deasia season is coming but Jinx ain't coming back but for season 2 I don't think any ship got nearly as much love as Jinx and Ekko as well Kate VI was drama after drama till they got freaky in prison Time Bomb managed to be just like Ekko minimal screen time Maximum Impact as we got Glimpse at a near Golden ending one where Ekko was with his loved ones an our Ekko has to live for the rest of his days knowing what could have been but while heartbreaking this was still a world he needed to see so that he can change and help change others so in the Name of Love let's talk

sarcastic RL go check that out that was an experience to make [Music] now to kick up the tears I want you all to know that the dance sequence is animated in four frames per second in reference to ekko's time limit and how we're not seeing the dance but eo's memories of it which is heart-wrenching I know before we go into it anymore we got to talk about the actual origins of this thing as just like Kate VI eeko having a thing for Jinx was something that was hinted many years ago CU if they had all that extra time they could fix any mistake now personally I hate League of Legends it did me very during in high school not because I played but because all my friends did and that was all they ever talked about so I had to get new ones so I eventually gave up and started reing up on the lore so I can pretend to follow along but from that sword lore one of the tidbits have always stuck with me was just the implied relationship between Diana and Leona but we're not here to talk about doomed year yet I had a crush until you started talking to the gun that's it by the way that's the one line has set up years of fan session over a pairing that has never had much in-game fuel but it was enough cuz cuz shippers are cracked like that I reject your reality and substitute my own see Ekko was the last of the core Trio to appear in game VI and jings all came out first with the lore being terrible so I'll just summarize VI was just a cop with amnesia Jin show up later and it was just heavily heavily implied that the two were siblings much like how Cade VI were bang we were working out very scant lore but that lore kept changing every 5 years so nobody really had the time to be super invested then Ekko showed up and PE people still didn't really care now to get this out of the way Ekko was basically just created to save zon's PR before this basically every champion from Zan was as the kids say evil as shit ranging from war criminals serial killers multiple current and former mad scientists with the rest being to use the proper word just terrorists the only non awful people associated with the city were the robot and a sentient piece of snot so realizing that they need to diversify the morality portfolio here and move away from just having to C be the place of the downtrend that are also constantly maligned Eko was created a heroon who fought to make it a better place instead of you know being a cop or terrorist Harley Quinn with us getting hints at Echo knew both VI and jinx as kids with this being where we got the confirmation that Ekko used to have a crush on jinx this was pretty much the only thing the phandom had to go on and then Arcane came out and people just accepted it as their new fucking religion as yeah this made the lore [Music] work now to keep the history lesson going Time Bomb was still prominent even in season 1 people looked at the new character designs and their Dynamic and just ran with this shit crafting fanworks that blew me away with just without one look was able to gize people into loving this straight couple pause for someone to comment about Jinx being by with no proof pause even longer for some point in the future where they actually confirm that shit and moving on Jinx and Ekko were really fun in season one which is fine because they don't say a godamn word to each other till it's time to throw down oh look who it is the boy savior like it's really funny how people like to imagine these two versus the actual limit screen time were shown as in act one they do not talk to each other echo's kind of the plus one to this orphan found family bullshit with the only people we see him talk to being VI and clager usually when he's spilling the tea hey so how did you find that place anyway this weirdo came into the shop vander's got to deal with the enforcers the extent of his onscreen interactions with Jinx is that like two seconds of them sitting next to each other they're working on what looks like a bomb but in spite that people still imagined a whole witch relationship between the two mainly off of that one music video stories which honestly I do love the Enemy music video as it gives us a nice glimpse of what powder Ekko and the rest were like growing up like before they had to deal with a massive Manhunt instead we had to see see him having fun goofing off dealing with yeah police brutality with it being made very clear that outside of her sister powder was the closest with Ekko which does make sense the two were around the same age Milo was kind of a dick who seemed to just pair with clager so if we're looking for powder's best friend then Ekko would fit the bill being silly with each other in ways that the older kids probably just would have shit on they're just hanging out stealing bikes trying to mimic Vis moves it's just a bunch of sweet little interactions that are just supposed between enforcer violence searches and Jinx for shadowing however while not super prevalent in Act One the rest of the show is able to do a pretty great job of making you long for simpler times in the tragedy of what they are [Music] now after everyone else ended up dead a furry or getting buff in prison powder became Jinx serving a sickle as a attack dog with the city bending the knee Ekko refusing to accept this created the fire lights who together would be the most consistent thorn in Silo's side composed primarily of former Shimmer addicts Ekko would work to undo all of Silo's deals act two opens with a fire like trying to put a dent in his Shimmer operation only for Jinx to show up and to start offing people this is the sad reality that VI has to contend with when she and Ekko meet up again as while VI still has Hope born from ignorance of what powder has become Ekko knows all too well what she is and what she's done with her actions being a big part of why he had to break away from the unders City and found his own Community to give just other people hope only for his attempts to be met with jinx's bullets Eko keeps amiro the Dead with a good number of them probably being jinx's work he's watched a lot of his friends die and that sticks with you and the worst part is he's kind of right Jinx is doing all this of her own free will there's no coercion or manipulation by Silo not because she has to but because she wants to Ekko has lived through jinx's worst and he's given up all hope on bringing back powder in anything other than a body bag she's a force to be stopped not reasoned with and when VI asked for help to save Jinx Ekko says no and I think the saddest thing here is that it never feels like Eko TR truly hates Jinx rather he just accepts that this is the reality of the situation she's made her choices she's killed his friends but he still Mourns who she used to be putting the girl she was right next to all the other people he's lost as to him powder is dead and all that's left is a problem that he has to put down EO hates Silko for all that he's done and most specifically killing benzo as after witnessing that it sticks with you but when he thinks about jinx it just seems to make him sad this is what it is and it needs to stop and adding extra drama to all this is that they both know what's up Jinx calls him the boy Savior and immediately tries to shoot him in the face this isn't Mass hero with a villain who doesn't know their real identity she knows it's him every time she pulls that trigger yet in spite of that when Ekko has her on the floor he still can't do it as even after all she's done all the friends she's killed when he sees her he still sees powder the girl he used to play games and goof off with still using the same moves and everything showing how some part of her still hasn't changed in spite of all that's happened then she tries to kill the both of them now Eko is basically rent out of the show after this Heimerdinger patches him up and the two just head back to his Treehouse but we as a fan base are still left with that moment of hesitation and people went wild with it you Google these two and the art is just always these designs as basically nothing pre-show matters as it should I think one line Echo has sets up everything that he'll experience in season 2 as well he may have seen just a bit of powder that doesn't mean he's forgiven Jinx or accepted that she can be saved it's really just he couldn't bring himself to kill her with those feelings get put on the back burner like Eko till episode 7 of season 2 where this one line just it ends up becoming diabolical in hindsight I should have been there for you for everyone that's a good way to drive yourself crazy ekko's tree was dying from magical pollution jaay bonked a little too hard sending the three across the Multiverse jaay got sent to a card hellscape from the future me Ekko got a world where everything he ever wanted is here I mean VI is dead but still this is a net positive for him he steals the body of some other version of himself and Ekko wakes up in a world where Zan and PTO has just settled their beef silco forgave Vander they worked together to make things better vi just died in an explosion and ekko's dating powder what is up with you you've been out of it all day yeah for those who didn't put this together they're already an item here or else he wouldn't be asking like can we pretend this is the first time not to mention everyone keeps referencing it constantly where would you be without her and low key this is terrifying to a man who just spent the last couple of years trying to not get killed by her also the reflection in the mirror showing old Jinx is such a dirty trick but I love it I think it's a great short hand for how initially Ekko perceives her in spite of like who is actually in front of his eyes this is ekko's biggest issue for someone who's been trying to build a better future and not get hung up on what could have been he is now being forced into one of those alternate scenarios and it is one giant mind fuck one then he now has to Grapple with the idea of staying and stealing some other guy's body forever or finding a way to break out and leaving just the best world behind and we know he's going to choose to go back because he's the best character and he honestly he does lose everything by the end of this series it's kind of crazy but Ekko here is forced to break from his previously held patterns that the things he used to cope is now being broken so that he can like start aesh this world is safe it's amazing and powder isn't dropping people like flies so now we watch Ekko overcome his figh ORF flight at just the sound of powder's voice and for him to finally see her for who she really is and in doing so finally be able to see Jinx or who she is though at the moment,"The relationship between Ekko and Jinx, known as 'Time Bomb,' is marked by deep emotional complexity, blending nostalgia, love, and tragedy. Initially hinted at in the game lore and later explored in Arcane, their bond evolves through heartbreaking moments, particularly Ekko's internal struggle between his memories of Powder (Jinx's former self) and the violent, unpredictable woman she becomes. Despite minimal interaction in the show, fan interest skyrocketed due to their shared past and emotional depth. Ekko's refusal to kill Jinx, even after her many actions that hurt him, exemplifies the lingering attachment to the girl he once knew. In alternate timelines, Ekko experiences a world where things could have been better, showing his yearning for a life with Jinx that never fully materializes. The ship’s tragic appeal lies in the bittersweetness of their connection, marked by moments of joy amidst an inevitable separation, reflecting the broader theme of lost potential. Their story leaves fans imagining alternate realities and what could have been."
ever since arcane came out there was one question that kept coming up is arcane canon well it was confirmed that arcane is different and that apparently it shouldn't be taken as the truth over the game so they are essentially saying that arcane is not exactly canon compared to the core universe which is exactly the opposite of what everyone wants i've heard that wright is still hesitant whether they want to turn this into the canon story to which i have to say yes riot everyone wants arcane to be canon i don't think there is a single person who wouldn't want that but here's the thing riot doesn't need to necessarily turn arcane into the main canon universe now i have never seen a marvel movie but i know that the cinematic universe is different from the core universe which is in the comics it seems like rat may be doing the same thing here it's that the arcane universe may be different from the canon core universe which is fine but i'm sad to see that some people will be confused because all of the characters in arcane changed from their canon versions and so today for once let me be the nerdy guy who reads everything you know all of those people who have read the game of thrones books and they talked about how different it is from the tv series i've never been one of those but today i will be because in this video we're gonna talk about all the differences between the core canon universe and the arcane universe and we'll see if there is any way to make arcane canon now of course i will not talk about the entire story of all the champions i will only talk about the stories up until the point where arcane would end because the rest of the story may still be referenced in season 2. so now without further ado let's start with the main characters of arcane victor and jace in the core universe jace's origins may be different his family house talis was never mentioned we only know that after he got into science he was offered patronage in clan giopara which was one of beltover's most respected ruling clans now not only have we never heard of jio para in arcane but in arcane jace actually gets patronage in the kiraman family which is something totally different according to jace's bio clan giopara was one of the first clans to explore shurima and find the hex crystals curiously enough in camille's story it is said that the pharaohs family were the first to find the hex crystals so we actually don't know which one of these was the first one but at least house pharaohs was referenced in arcane clan giopara where jace is supposed to be never even appeared there anyway after jace accepted the offer and he joined the clan he spent most of his early years constructing potential hextech devices and designing transformable multi-tools for the working class the difference here is that in the core universe basic hextech was already developed it wasn't advanced there are no major hex devices unless you maybe count camille but you know we don't actually know how old she is but in arcane it was jayce who invented hextech in the core universe jace's personality is also different he is supposed to be far more arrogant than he is in arcane he was described as dismissive and unwilling to slow his space to help his peers catch up it was so bad most people didn't want to work with him and as he grew older his patients grew even shorter so yeah jace is supposed to be a pretty awful guy while in arcane he actually cared about the people around him and he even stopped hextech development for the safety of people in the core universe especially when he was younger that would be out of character some time later he finally found a person who was able to keep up with his intellect and that person was victor in the core universe they met at a mandatory progress day party and they bonded over the fact that neither of them wanted to be there in arcane they met after jinx blew up his lab anyway at this progress they party victor expanded jace's intellectual horizons and he challenged many of his assumptions we then learned that while jace wanted to help humanity through versatile technology victor wanted to solve problems inherited to humanity itself such as physical decay or illogical prejudice they constantly argued with each other but their conflicts never got personal they respected each other's work because they still had a common goal in arcane you can rarely ever see them argue over an invention later the two invent a mechanized construction suit for piltover's dog workers it was light enough to not let the workers drown but sturdy enough to enhance their strength finally the two inventors got into a major argument when victor wanted to give the suit an implant that would increase the wearer's strength and prevent them from getting tired panicking or disobeying instructions from their superiors you see victor wanted to do this because he knew it would dramatically reduce the number of accidents but jace didn't want to go through with it because he found the removal of free will immoral they disagreed with each other so much the two nearly fought over this but once again it ended with jayce being an awful person he ran up into the academy and warned the professors about victor's invention because of this victor was stripped of his honor and kicked out of the scientific community after losing his only real friend jace returned back to his awful arrogant personality and he studied alone this is where he got a hold of a hextech gem in arcane he got it from the kiriman family here he got it through clan giopara but in a really different way when clan giopara obtained a hextech gem none of their students were able to tap into its power but at that point jace was so arrogant his superiors wanted to teach him a lesson and so they punished him by not even offering the gem to him only after everyone else failed as the very last person they finally gave jace a chance and so he did his own experiments on it these experiments were very similar to what we saw in arcane but in the core universe he did those without victor however these experiments led into a power spike you know in arcane it actually exploded and this power spike was detected by victor and so he arrived at jace's lab demanding only one thing you see victor also spent some time alone working on his own projects and he figured out how to save everyone he knew how to eradicate disease hunger and hatred if jayce joined him they could save humanity from itself all he needed was the hextech gem for what he called a glorious evolution jace disagreed telling victor that what he really needed was a moral compass and the two started a fight hilariously enough even though in arcane viktor is very fragile in the core universe victor grabbed the crystal and knocked jace unconscious with it just picture that in your head anyway victor then returned back to his lab did all sorts of things to himself and jace used his own hextech powered inventions to fight him that's really all we need to know about these two most of these scenes will be adapted into arcane in season 2. so the major differences from arcane was that jace's hammer was a mining tool which he powered up by a small shard of the hextech crystal which he got during the experiments the atlas gauntlets were not actually his invention he just figured out how to power them up but more than that he had no connection to the kiraman family whatsoever so in the core universe caitlyn and jace haven't really talked to each other that much but from victor's perspective this story has some more differences the reason why victor cares about the mind affecting implants is because victor comes from zorn just like in arcane and there he studied all the frequent accidents after doing so he found out it all came not to mechanical failure but to human error that's why he's heavily into augmentation he knows that most of human suffering comes from humans anyway after taking interest in safety victor was accepted into the ferguson camp forge where he worked as a safety inventor within a month of him working there the cam forge dropped down to zero accidents and this is where we got a big difference when he was 19 he was surprised to be offered a place in zone's prestigious academy of techmatargy there victor attracted the eye of stanwick padilla who convinced victor to leave zorn and go to the academy of piltover instead so in the core universe it was stanwick padilla who convinced victor to go to piltover instead of staying in zone in arcane it was revealed it was heimerdinger who offered him a place in piltover so he skipped zone entirely and that's because in arcane stanwick was long dead so they just straight up removed that character they confirmed this in one of the episodes you can even see standrick's statue there but this is where another major difference comes in in the core universe by now the two cities were known as spilt over and zone in arcane that is not the case there the entire city is simply built over and the possibility of the city splitting into two and being called built over and so on was only being voted in at the very end of season 1. so throughout all of those stories in arcane zone didn't exist they simply called it the undercity so that's why in arcane victor being at the university of zaun wouldn't make sense because in arcane zone doesn't exist it will likely become a thing at the beginning of season 2 after the two halves finally split anyway as we mentioned in jace's half the two meet at a party but in victor's bio we learned that while the two were still friends there was a chemical spill that destroyed an entire district of zorn this is likely the same disaster that led into the augmentation of orianna but that's not important now what's important is that during this disaster victor returned home to help in the civilian rescues however it was dangerous to be there in person the streets were full of toxic fumes and so victor constructed blitzcrank to help in the cleanup blitzcrank was such a good creation he started to think on his own which wasn't really victor's intention in the story the two kinda became friends and they tried to help those affected by the toxins but since even when working together the two couldn't prevent more death they just parted ways and since blitzcrank was developing his own personality victor just let him go off and do whatever he wanted after all blitzcrank was developed to help people and save lives of course blitzcrank didn't appear in arcane but i do believe they may be saving him for season 2. they did reference cranking stuff a couple of times in season 1. anyway after this disaster was over when victor returned back to piltover he learned that professor stanwick stole credit for blitzcrank's creation and when victor filed a complaint about it nobody believed him this made him return to his inventions with jace and together they created the diving suit and the rest of the story happened so as you can see the differences are actually quite big victor has no sickness in the core universe also his story heavily relies on stanwick padilla who was quite an ass but that person isn't even alive in arcane also in arcane it was heimerdinger who praised him while in the core universe that wasn't the case also no sky and no hex core being developed with jace so while the glorious evolution of victor will be interesting to watch in arcane because there he is literally saving his own life in the core universe he is simply improving his own body he wants to make sure he can't make mistakes which would put people into dangerous situations he is doing it to save lives not just his own now with these two dealt with let's now move on to the other main characters there is vai vy's origins are actually quite different this is what the bio says though she had ended up in the crumbling hope house orphanage a notorious mad some scrapper claimed to have found her adrift in a bassinet large enough for two in the ruins of a collapsed cam lab so yeah in the core universe vi was an orphan straight up from the beginning but in arcane she was not an orphan up until the uprising which is where her parents got killed and where vander found her anyway in the core universe while being an orphan vai formed a gang and she did all the typical street kid stuff this is very similar to what she did with milo and klager and she then found a mentor in the owner of a bar on the edge of the lanes of course this is where the bio is referencing vander but his name was never revealed because it was kept a secret for arcane so yes vander is canon we then learned that this mentor helped her comb her self-destructive tendencies and refined her moral code we then get to the story of how she got her gauntlets which is also very different she planned a heist of a rich mine she needed more people to pull it off and so she brought in the factory wood fiends gang during the heist this gank killed the owner of the mines the one who was supposed to get all the payment which they were looking for and in doing so the gang also trapped all the other miners in the tunnels even as both gangs fled with the loot vai didn't want to let innocent people die and so she grabbed a pair of mining oversized pulverizer gauntlets and used them to smash open a path to free the miners then still wearing the gauntlets she gave the entire fiends gank and i quote a legendary beating this is where the storyline of arcane would have ended but interestingly enough vai still references the civil war of arcane this is what it says vai eventually disappeared from zone during a,"Arcane is not officially considered part of the main League of Legends canon, with Riot acknowledging its distinct universe, though it may influence future lore. The core universe differs significantly from Arcane, especially in character backstories and events. For instance, Jace in the core universe is more arrogant, and his connection to Victor and Hextech development differs from Arcane's portrayal. Vi's origins as an orphan differ from her Arcane story, where she is taken in by Vander after her parents' deaths. Jinx's story in the core universe lacks the depth and backstory provided in Arcane. Caitlyn’s arc is also more faithful to her canon version, with no significant connections to the other characters. Singed’s backstory in the core universe is similarly different, focusing on his work in Piltover and his experiments, while Echo’s origin and relationship with his parents in the core universe contrasts with the more orphaned version seen in Arcane. The show presents a reimagined version of many characters, deviating from their established lore, leading to fan desire for it to become canon."
Arcane is a masterclass in how to write amazing women every one of these characters is just a work of art and storytelling and characterization and it's weird to say but it seems like everyone is happy which is crazy no one ever agrees on stuff like this so what happened how is it all so good so while I as a man definitely hesitate to make a video that's like allow me a male man to tell all you female women how to write the ladies this is about Arcane not about me you know if anything this is about me as a writer who is really looking for guidance on this topic not a lot of stories do this this well and as a guy I really want to learn more about how to write great women characters and this show just taught me so much so this video isn't a how too it's about what I personally learned and these are basically just a bunch of incredible storytelling things that Arcane did that I believe deserve to be highlighted and celebrated and encouraged and I love any and all discussion in the comments adding questioning critiquing whatever the more the merrier especially if you're a woman and you have opinions on this kind of thing I'm here to learn so I want to hear your thoughts and by the way let me add one really surprising thing about this whole situation which is that AR Kean does a lot of things that could go really wrong a lot of tropes that are just like minefields for bad writing when it comes to women Arcane has a manipulative seductive fem fatal they have a macho action girl who beats up Men twice their size they have a manic pixie SL broken girl who's arguably fixed by man they have a beautiful but doesn't realized Outcast girl who gets a naked shower scene and the way arcan does it it's great it works it's all these things that we want in our lady characters deep Nuance realistic empowering so let's get to the actual characters here I want to go through each character in relation to topic or Trope where I think the writing really made them shine and the first of those characters is is Mel and the first topic is agency agency is the ability of characters to make choices that change the course of events and the exercising of that ability and this is a big one I think this is the main thing we see in failed attempts at writing strong women what we often see is characters who might be physically strong might be skilled might be independently minded but then we see them just being tossed around by the plot or by the decisions of the men in the story never making any actual decisions themselves arcanes women have agency they make a ton of important decisions Mel has the final say with the development of hex she pushes for hex weapons she pushes for war and then changes course and pushes for peace and the whole time she is the pivotal voice on the council leading them in whatever decision they make Seva is a henchwoman which seems like a very follower role but remember that she basically makes Silko she dethrones Vander takes away all his power and makes Silko the new Under City boss VI disobeys Vander to sacrifice herself and then when he exercises his agency right back to stop her she uses hers again to go after him and fight for him Jinx def finds her own identity at the end she sets the whole thing up figures it out on her own and then takes action when she's done but I think Mel is the best example of this she starts out with an incredible amount of agency in the form of actual political power she has like a direct onetoone influence over other council members she's wealthy and proactively seeking to increase her wealth and influence but like I mentioned a lot of women start out in positions like these where they hold positions of power and we already to see them use it and then something happens why or really where do characters like this lose their agency so I think it most often gets lost when the characters get into relationships especially if it's an important charismatic man with strong opinions or a strong role it also can often get lost and developing conflicts and the weaknesses of the character and the other scenario is that it often gets taken away by a competing strong woman Mel meets each of these scenarios coming out stronger than she was when she went in she gets into a relationship with Jace and by the way even getting into this relationship she has a rare show of agency she sleeps with Jace because she wants him that's not something you usually see Star is letting women do it's taboo but Arcane showcases that decision of hers very openly and confidently but anyway she gets into this relationship and he doesn't take away her agency at all on the contrary she uses the relationship to further her goal and then she confronts her weakness who is a strong woman literally coming to take away her agency and she doesn't let her she grows through that experience and ends up in a situation where she and jce are equally dependent on each other's agency to bring the council to vote for peace Jace initiates it but the council violently protests until Mel changes their course by exerting her political influence which far supered chases so Mel starts with agency and it only increases but I want to zero in here on one characteristic of mels that relates very strongly to her agency really one of her most Central characteristics overall and it feels a little weird highlighting this as a central characteristic because normally that's bad writing and or just not true that it matters so much but here it does matter and it's great writing so one of Mel's most prominent features is how beautiful she is and making this a major characteristic of a woman is often a recipe not just for shallowness but for passivity that's why we think of it as a bad thing to build a character around but for Mel her beauty does the opposite it's an aid to her agency she uses her beauty to get done what she wants to get done and it's not just a one note bat my eyelashes get money type trade no she already manipulates people in all kinds of ways complex Ways by appealing to faulty self-image by offering them Power by scaring them by bribing them this is a character who can paint a picture and use it to unsettle two different characters in two completely different ways she uses everything at her disposal to send messages Foster relationships manipulate people whatever she needs to do to achieve her ends so they took this characteristic which has such potential to erase complexity and take away agency and they use it to add to her complexity and Aid her agency and just to talk a bit more how this relates to some of the other characters just like with Mel it's very clear that Arina is using a character first approach when it comes to attractiveness which is why they end up with hot characters that are also good characters and to contrast when we see a poorly written hot character it's like the starting point is the characteristic they pick a characteristic that's attractive like a boob and now what sort of person shall we craft around this boob and that's obviously Destin for shallow when you start from the other way from the character it leads to a much more layered approach to character attractiveness VI is a fighter what type of attractiveness are we going to give her well a character with her skill set wouldn't be voluptuous she'd be toned she'd have confidence Swagger she'd have scars we take elements of her story she's a prisoner so she has tattoos she has a jacket she stole from someone who's trying to mug her Jinx you know Jinx was an interesting challenge because she was designed in game to be the Psycho Sexy type by the way not letting the fan base know if she's of legal age very efficient meta solution forces otherwise thirsty fans to focus on her personality clever thinking Arcane very clever but they also gave her this messiness we see smudges of dirt on her face dark circles under her eyes this is a far cry from the no hair out of place to will be often C for any character of any level of attractiveness Kate is obviously part of this conversation but there's a a lot to talk about with her so we'll get back to her at the end but overall Beauty makes arcane's characters deeper and more complex instead of shallower and simpler and if we look at VI what I want to talk about next we see this exact same phenomenon but with strength the major bad reading Trope they avoid with VI is the action girl and action girls aren't bad but it's a Trope that I think everyone from pretty much every perspective out there rolls their eyes at hard when it's done poorly I think we all know the story of this Trope women in fiction used to be mostly weak dainty fragile things that needed help fting their battles from the big strong men in the story when we say objectifying this is the most literal form of it where women are really basically objects through their passivity and through only being valuable for their looks so that's more or less where things were and then the pendulum starts swinging back the other way we got women who were beautiful but could also fight but sometimes it still seemed like it was just a facade build over the same old objectification and really before we got too many characters who are balanced we were happy with the pendulum started swinging further and further and we got several variations here that it seems like no one likes variation number one is the man plus boobs action girl take a very masculine personality and role at surface level femininity and congrats you reach your quota for women in your story these characters range from the one of the Bros types to women who are toxic to other women to easy access for a romance that doesn't really fit with anyone's personalities they're basically female and name only and the impression I get is that people who want to see strong women characters don't really feel like they're getting women with this variation the defined by my gender action girl is variation number two this character is feminine but her whole personality is basically just not being accepted by men it's her major conflict it's most of her dialogue it's in subtext everywhere and this type of character not only feels one-dimensional but very much still defined by the men in her world it's just an antagonistic relationship but she hasn't escaped that limitation variation number three is the auto overpowered action girl this character is stronger and more skilled than all of the male characters without any training without trying without earning anything that characters usually have to earn in order to get to that level and the main problem that comes up here is you have people just not respecting the character and it's a shallow type of strength usually that these characters have since it took nothing of their inner selves to get it I want to talk about that last one first because they navigated this perfectly they did it right away in VI's first fight scene and it doesn't start here when the fight starts it starts right here giving VI a slow-mo ugly getting socked in the jaw shot that's something not every story is willing to do with her action girl that's the first thing they did right but the payoff is actually here in this scene that comes right after the fight because the fight itself isn't what convinces us that VI is strong it's this moment wait want to see how that ends [Music] V won this fight but it's not like it was this badass hear me roar moment no VI got beat up it was pretty even but she won and only then does she pull the just triy it line totally different scene if she says this without taking all those ugly punches first now we believe she's strong we believe she's Brave think of that cheesy Rocky quote but a about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward if you want to show the action girl is strong you need to show her getting hit otherwise you did just write another fragile delicate flower just one who can throw a punch and this isn't a gender based thing action guys need this moment just as much we don't want to see characters exhibit outer strength we want to see outer strength that comes from an inner strength and that's why we believe VI when she's fighting on the bridge even though by physical standards it seems unrealistic we've already bought into her Inner Strength that's what we respect that's all we care about now VI doesn't fit the other action girl tropy archetypes either but I think we can make use of a better example here to continue this discussion and if you seen my videos you know that if I'm talking about VI that means I'm about to talk about someone else there's another very strong character where they took the opposite approach and this has to do with the man plus boobs action girl and it's not just action girl for this archetype this is the broader category of man role plus woman gender equals fully developed character that's what we're navigating around here so this Pitfall is actually one of the easier ones to circumvent if man plus boobs is your only female character you're in trouble but if you have a range of characters with varying levels of femininity and masculinity then this becomes really interesting if you put in the effort to make it interesting and that's why I want to talk about all three of these characters together ceva Grayson and ambessa are women in traditionally masculine roles we rarely see Hench women or women having cloud in the Underworld because of physical strength we rarely see women police Chiefs and we rarely see women generals and with each of these characters we,"Arcane excels at writing strong, nuanced female characters, defying common tropes and showcasing their agency. Characters like Mel, VI, and Jinx exemplify how women can hold power, make pivotal decisions, and maintain their complexity without losing their autonomy, even when faced with challenges such as romantic relationships or strong adversaries. The show subverts traditional tropes, using attributes like beauty and strength to enhance character depth rather than reduce it, portraying women as multifaceted individuals with their own desires and motivations. VI's portrayal avoids typical action girl pitfalls, showing her strength through vulnerability and resilience. By creating diverse female characters with agency, Arcane offers a masterclass in character writing."

I recruited Arcane on my own for $0 the series holds the record of being the most expensive animated series ever created now I wanted to see if I can recreate a scene from the show without spending any money at all all the tools I use will be free and all the assets I need will be made by me and after looking at every official making of material I could find I think I've not only discovered the techniques they've used to create the show but also what it takes to create something truly special yeah you make me nous true this was probably the most important part of this whole project if I can't recreate this rocket launcher close enough I might as well cancel the whole project because it will only really get harder from here and I need it for the actual scene anyway so I might as well start with it as a 3D artist creating the model wasn't really an issue I was more worried about the special technique Arcane uses to shade their 3D objects they paint every model including some of the shadows and highlights by hand the last time I painted a model in this way it was almost 2 years ago so I wasn't really sure if I could recreate the style well enough now I started by blocking out the basic colors and some simple Shadows to define the basic shapes of the model afterwards I refined the most important parts which also allowed me to add smaller details that aren't actually in the 3D model itself now it already looks pretty good but it doesn't really react to any Lighting in the 3D scene yet so to finish it I plugged the final textures into a Shader so that it looks like it is actually living in the environment around it and this is the final result I think this looks good enough to continue so now let's go a little bit more in depth and see what it takes to create a full Arcane style animation St for a minute just like creating the rocket launcher you can separate the process for the whole animation into two main steps as well with one bonus Step at the end that the creators like to call the secret ingredient this three-step process is what most objects go through to reach their final look in the show including of course Jinx no off I'm I'm try Focus figh I started by sculpting her body with the help of some references from the show in most big Productions you would start with 2D concept art for each character and then 3D artists try to cre those Concepts as closely as [Music] possible the scene I'm trying to recreate is the one at the end of season 1 where she fires the rocket launcher for the first time I already have one part of it so all that's missing now is jinx there's also the environment but I don't need to create a 3D model for that and I will explain why a bit later during the process for now the main and most important goal is to recreate jinx as closely as possible the biggest problem with that is just like her rocket launcher a lot of the details on her have been added while painting her textures they're not part of the actual 3D model which makes working with references a lot harder luckily I actually found a render of her without the textures as well look at how different she looks so much smoother than you might expect this is intentional to make the textures look as good as possible once you add lighting to them as well but that cre another problem for me I can try to create the 3D model as closely as possible but until I have painted her textures I don't really know if I've captured her look well enough if everything goes wrong I might have to redo the whole 3D model these moments of uncertainty happened multiple times during this project either because I had to work up to a certain step to see if the results look good enough or even worse I tried a technique I've never really used before and with jinx's body and outfit looking pretty good so far one of those scary steps was coming up next the hair in Arcane has a very unique look it's made up of these very big and Broad shapes combined with smaller sometimes very fine strands which confused me a little bit at first I watched every making off video I could find to figure out how they created it until I found this 1 second clip that told me that they've used xgen it's a common tool mainly used to create 3D hairstyles with individual strands just like real hair and unfortunately it's part of Maya which costs all the money so I had to stick to using blender myself but now I had to make a decision I can either create a reliable and pretty good looking hairstyle with blender's hair prodicle system or create a great looking hairstyle by basically programming my own unique hair system using geometry nodes that is much riskier unstable and might not even work at all and could easily waste more than 20 hours in the process I decided to do option two and guess what it only took uh 44 hours and I'm sure nothing will go wrong with it in the future anyway let me show you how it works to summarize the very boring math behind this first you create a tube like this then the system turns it into these hair strands and afterwards you can customize it with the settings the last thing missing is the Shader which I learned how to create through this tutorial by lightning Boy Studio now with her 3D model finished there are two more steps to finish the 3D portion of this project for her to move she needs to have a rig basically a skeleton to move the different parts of her body this process can get very complex depending on how much control you want to have while animating luckily blender has an amazing free add-on called rigify that allows you to create one of these complex rigs with a single button press all you need to do is place the basic bones and the add-on will do the rest automatically and after a little bit of tweaking and adjusting it works pretty well you can actually do quite a lot with this rig now but one thing you can't do is this right here forti the studio behind arcade not only used rigs to control their characters but also shape Keys shape keys are optional deformations on the model that you can use to create certain effects they're often used for example to make Expressions more expressive or here for example they created them to make Jinx look younger and more innocent I created that same slider from my model 2 as well as two more to have a bit more control over her lips but you could go a lot further with these if you really wanted to and now the last 3D part of this project is the actual animation of course she can't just look like Jinx she also needs to move like her so to recreate the scene as closely as possible I placed the original animation with transparency over my 3D camera my first goal was to match the most significant poses as best as I can afterwards I can blend between them with a few more in between poses and blenders automatic interpolation which fills the rest of the frames this is actually how most animations are created first you lay out the most important poses then you create the rest to blend between them the difference between me and the actual animators on Arcane is of course that they didn't have this perfect reference to trace instead they filmed themselves acting out the scenes to better understand how the character needs to move during them so they don't have to guess the whole animation process went surprisingly smooth there were not really any problems that occurred during this step except for my custom hair system of course and if I can't fix this issue I might have to create the entire hairstyle again from scant with the other system but you know what this can wait let's do something more exciting [Music] first texture painting is one of the things I was the least comfortable with during this whole project but after painting the rocket launcher I felt at least a bit more confident in my skills I basically just followed the same process again first blocking out the general shapes and colors then refining everything and adding some more [Music] detail on its own blender's texture painting has always been extremely annoying and tedious to me but there were two things I used during this project that made the process a lot more enjoyable the first is a free add-on called yuku paint it adds essential features like paint layers as well as some really great quality of life features like automatic Shadow Generation or a much easier way to work out basic colors if you do a lot of texture painting this add-on is really really good especially in combination with the second thing which is my own custom brush pack blender itself only really has a single round default brush which is exactly why I created this brush pack with 50 custom brushes to cover as many use cases as possible for this Arcane project it actually worked pretty well to only use the hard round brush to paint everything but in my previous project for example I use it to paint This Grass Hill covered in snow for my berserk animation or to recreate this scene from Spirited Away if you're interested in getting this pack for yourself make sure to check out the first link in the description and now with my custom brushes in hand my plan for the texture painting was once again to only really refine the parts that are clearly visible and leave the rest in a fairly rough State just to save a little bit of time that I could then use to fix my hair system [Music] now it was finally time to see whether my Jinx looks like the original or I have to redo a bunch of stuff the biggest thing I struggled with was imitating this looseness that the original has sometimes the colors blend really well together and sometimes you can clearly see some very broad brush Strokes that look kind of rough but still somehow work really well together you can almost see the confidence and intention behind every one of them the confidence that I myself was lacking but with enough time and patience I think I am pretty happy with the result now let's see if I can figure this miss out and I actually did it only took 6 hours this time basically nothing now it's basically perfect except for this flickering that I just could not nope you know what I want that to be there anyway speaking of texture painting I also painted the environment well at least partially I basically grabbed a shot from the original and used photo a free web version version of Photoshop to remove Jinx from the shot and if that didn't work completely I fixed the rest in blender using texture painting now there are only two more steps left before the animation is fully done one of them is fairly simple the other one is the step I was the most excited but also the most scared [Music] of the first one are the 2D VFX in the actual show 2D animators created these extra Effects by painting on top of the 3D animation probably in a software made for 2D animation that costs a lot of money but you can create something pretty similar in blender as well by adding a grease pencil object into the 3D scene you can paint basically anywhere in 3D space so to paint the VX on top I just place the drawing layer in front of my 3D camera so it covers the scene behind it now all I had to do is redraw the animation from the original frame by frame which wasn't really that hard it just took a long time [Music] time for this I also decided not to trace the frames exactly like I did for the 3D animations because I thought drawing them myself would be more fun it's a pretty simple process overall and I'm sure I've missed some steps that made this process a lot better but also a lot harder in the actual show but that's how I created these shots for my own version now on to the last and probably also most important step of them all the secret ingredient that makes Arcane look so great this tiny clip perfectly shows what that means all the elements of the scene are already there in the shot but what gives the show its unique look and feel is being created during the composition stage they are intentionally vague about this process in they're making off videos so it's hard to find any concrete info but here's how I think they did it looking at this clip again the process seems to start with the raw textures without any lighting then during compositing the lighting gets added in some sort of way on top of that we can also see some more typical effects like lens dird or glare that you would usually add during compositing as well as the 2D effects of course that need to be combined with the 3D animation at some point to me it seems like they collect all the elements that make up a scene separately and then combine them all together in compositing to create the final look the reason why I think they do it that way is because that gives them ultimate creative control don't like the shading on the face just remove it from where you don't want it and enhance it where you need more don't like the hair color well now you can change it want to put more emphasis on the eyes select only the eyes to brighten them so they stick out more this ultimate flexibility is I think what allowed them to create such a unique animation style in the first place the 3D render gives you photo realistic shading but you don't have to use it if you think it looks better without it maybe you want to add your own,"The transcript describes the creation of an Arcane-inspired animation using free tools and self-made assets. The process involved modeling, texturing, rigging, and animating a scene from the show, focusing on replicating the unique visual style of Arcane, especially its hand-painted 3D textures and distinctive hair. The creator had to overcome challenges such as mastering the show's shading techniques, creating a custom hair system, and dealing with uncertainty about whether the results would match the original's look. It also highlights the importance of compositing, where raw textures, lighting, and 2D effects were combined to achieve the final style. The project was supported by the community through Patreon and merchandise sales, with plans for further episodes."
the question you should be asking isn't is jinx alive what you should be asking is where is she going and why because when you really look into the end of Arcane season 2 it's pretty obvious that she didn't die I mean come on Riot would not kill Jinx guys we've lost too much already benzo smech freaking Isa a small child don't get me wrong I've seen children die in Arcane but it didn't hit like Isa but I'm serious Jinx isn't dead and I'm going to prove it to you and talk about the more important questions of why she's still alive and where she's going next before we get into act three let's remember what happened Isa dies VI pulls her away Caitlyn throws her in jail there won't be a trial I'm giving you this one chance to account for your actions all the pain you've caused now I can't justify all of jinx's actions but damn you know like Isa just died and I'm going to be honest I don't get sad from video games or movies ever I didn't shed a tear in Titanic but Isa hit me so you can imagine how hard that hit Jinx and then what happens she gets thrown in jail and someone telling her you need to make up for all the pain that you caus others M now I'm not saying this is the only reason for Jinx wanting to kill herself but I'm contributing factor so now let's get into the other timeline stuff of act three because it is important and is relevant to jinx in our timeline after all Eko does save her life wait first not really relevant to the theory but just cool we start in the other timeline the one Echo and hinger got thrown into after coming in contact with the anomaly in the reflection you can see Jinx from r timeline and another thing that's pretty cool is the vinyl at the beginning now we always see this vinyl play at the start of every episode it has VI on one side and Jinx on the other it say a Netflix series but in this timeline it's different the main characters in this one I do consider Vine Jinx the main characters in Arcane but the main characters in this timeline since VI's dead is actually Ekko and powder then she gives this peace sign over ekko's forehead which is a common theme for Jinx actually we see in season 2 Act 2 Jinx and VI's mother used to do this then in season 1 when Ekko and Jinx are lining up to fight on the bridge we see a couple flashbacks of them as kids and Jinx does this again just really showing that the past here is pretty similar there's one fundamental change that caused this timeline to shift and end up here the main thing for Jinx here is that you could say she's good in this timeline also interesting is that jinx's hair has the side bangs like Vander compared to her front swoop in our timeline which is more like how we see Silko in the flashbacks this is because she was raised by Vander not by Silko here Ekko paints a mural of VI similar to how he did in our timeline but this time it's just VI because she's really the only one they lost and Jinx comments on this I was strong because she was afraid well her fear of losing us is what made her fight so hard and I think this is another commonality between timelines that you should keep in mind VI fights hard because she's afraid of losing anyone think about how many times VI has literally tried to sacrifice herself to save everyone else I can do this myself no one else needs to get hurt and I think this has a lot to do with why Jinx I think leaves at the end of season 2 and that'll make more sense later and then then Echo tells her sometimes taking a Leap Forward means leaving a few things behind both of these lines are really relevant to how we End season 2 and I realize you're thinking oh this is from a different timeline but you'll see in the end now they're working on creating Echo Z drive now how do they discover the anomaly that makes Echo Z Drive possible well he says it right here I was playing with inversions on Jace's acceleration Rune the same Rune that Jace was given by who we now know as Victor in the very beginning of Arcane this is really important we're going to go over all of this with the runes and Arcane and how we ended up where we are and who's the real hero of Arcane in a separate video that's coming out after this one this one I'm going to focus really on Jinx now this dancing scene for one Echo references again later but look at the parallels to when we first See Echo and Jinx meet in our timeline this is the moment where Jinx is helping silco ship Shimmer and the fire lights come and break up the whole thing [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hi now after this this scene Ekko and powder are sitting on this ledge and we've seen this ledge before if you remember back in season 1 in our timeline powder and vice sat here but remember in this timeline the main characters aren't Jinx and VI they're Echo and powder now this is also very important what does Echo say here I used to dream the unders City could be like this but somewhere I I gave up on it gave up on you I think this really has to do a lot with why Ekko tries so hard to save drinks when he returns to our timeline he realizes that in his timeline he gave up on Powder powder's gone VI all that's left is jinx and she belongs to you're wrong and he probably shouldn't have now finally I just want to point this out I don't actually think Heimerdinger is dead I don't believe someone's dead unless you actually see them dead like smech yeah smech died uh Essa yeah ambessa is dead Heimerdinger is not dead because he literally says here before he jumps out of the anomaly back in a wink back in a wink no at this point Heimerdinger has studied the Arcane for a while I think he at least has some understanding of what's going to happen to him and I don't know where he went here but if there's anyone who could find their way back from wherever he goes it's Heimerdinger and I know there's a bunch of stuff with Jace here I'm not going to talk about it in this video I promise we'll get into all of that in the next video with Jace and Victor and the runes and how it all works cuz I know there's a lot of confusion on that let's get back to our timeline and what's the first thing we see Jinx say when we see her in jail if you're here to kill me make sure to finish the job I thinks you've changed she can't accept what you and I know there are no Happy Endings immediately we're caught that Jinx is at a very low point it follows up with her saying that VI can't accept what Caitlyn and her both know that there are no Happy Endings and Jinx is feeling pretty guilty about things telling kin that she didn't know her mom was there referencing when Jinx blew up the pilen council with a hextech rocket at the end of season one and after this she starts I wouldn't even call it hallucinating more like she's envisioning like this is what this this this is the conversation that's playing out in her head now what's important here is she says killing isn't mercy and she's done a lot of killing pretty sure she has one of the highest kill counts in the show maybe Victor and Vander AKA Warwick are the only ones with potentially more this is a different Jinx and what sille's response killing is a cycle one that started long before Vander and me and that will continue long after the two of you this is all happening in jinx's mind this is her own conversation so's not actually there and she's coming to a realization about everything that has happened and he says long after the two of you which is obviously referencing her and VI there was a cycle of killing I'm done running in circles she's saying she wants to get out of this cycle of killing saying that she's going to break the cycle between her and VI right there she saying I'm done running in circles and what stops people from breaking these Cycles the prisons we build ourselves we build our own prisons bars forged of Oaths cod's commitments silco someone who fell victim to this cycle of killing says that he thought he could break free by eliminating his jailers that's I thought I could break free by eliminating those I deemed my jailers that would be PT over to him I think the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away now what does Jinx see as her jailers what what's actually causing all of this she probably thinks not of piltover but of hextec what started all this what allowed for the rocket that launched where did all of this violence stem from okay maybe it was the hextech gemstone but Silko saying he thought it was his jailers but it only stops when you have the will to walk away is telling Jinx she's telling herself really remember it's it's her conversation that getting rid of hextech isn't the solution the only way it ends is when someone walks away that's the only way the cycle breaks from this point on Jinx is finding the will to walk away now her first solution is not the best but we'll get into that there's all this talk of the cycle of killing the cycle between Vander and silico and now who shows up of course VI Jinx what's the first thing Jinx says to her you're never going to give up on me are you she's not saying that in a good thing like oh wow you're never going to give up on me she's like you're never going to give up on me because Jinx thinks there's no coming back for her she doesn't see herself as good she thinks she's destructive she hurts people I understand people watching might think oh no Jinx has has a lot of good qualities and she's done a lot of good with her life but that's not how Jinx sees herself which is more important and her saying you're never going to give up on me shows that this cycle of killing is not going to stop unless she herself finds the will to walk away hey you don't have to worry about me anymore there's no good version of me what are you going to do break the cycle then you get a gun punch and look how fast Jinx is like lightning speed I ask what are you going to do and Jinx says break the cycle and the conclusion she comes to Breaking that cycle is killing herself she Burns everything the last drop silko's office all the while the song is playing saying The World Is A Wasteland please let me go and I think Jinx feels like she's contributed a lot to this Wasteland and the only way for it to stop is for her to be gone and break this cycle of killing with her and VI this world is a Wast where nothing can wait and who arrives at the last second Ekko and this time he's not going to give up on her and I love how they're showing eeko utilize the Z Drive he's still feeling like that explosion when he gets hit the second he comes back you can see the smoke Rising off of him that's how the Z Drive works it doesn't really fix Echo that's what you have to remember so if Ekko gets stabbed or something and then uses the Z drive it doesn't take away the Stab Wound right he still got stabbed these Burns he's feeling them and then he uses the Z dve before so much damage that he can't recover it doesn't change him it just reverses everything else around him and reverses his placement and what and what does he say that finally gets her to stop instantly doing it wait when he shows up always a dance with you now this isn't the same dance that he just had with her in the other timeline but a dance nonetheless and then I don't know where this comes from I looked everywhere for this quote line anyone who's ever told Ekko this I don't think actually anyone says it to him I think he comes to this conclusion by himself you know I I learned from someone very special that no matter what happened in the past it's never too late to build something new someone worth building it for I don't know where he got this from it's either Heimerdinger or just his interactions with the jinkx and other timeline I thought for sure that it was Jinx in the other timeline that had told him this somewhere at some point but I scrubbed through the whole season 2 multiple times and I I don't hear Heimerdinger or powder from the their timeline ever say anything like this so if anyone knows where he got it from let me know but I think it's more like he discovered it himself and that's what he learned from someone else go go please let me go well needless to say she does eventually step away from the ledge and then we have this noxus pilt ofen war with noxus helping Victor push to the anomaly and sure there are some really satisfying deaths I'm talking Maddie and she's definitely the reason why this bomb doesn't go off you can see that she was the one holding the bomb and so she probably tampered with it before she handed it off you can see that there's a little screw plac in there but look how awesome this is so Mel doesn't just deflect the bullet she also puts Maddie in a ball so that the bullet will just keep bouncing around until it kills her I did appreciate your warmth but for the most part piltover is getting wrecked here,"The main question about Jinx’s fate in Arcane is not whether she's alive, but where she is going and why. After the events of Season 2, it's clear Jinx is still alive, despite her low point in jail where she reflects on the cycle of violence she is caught in, largely due to the creation of Hextech and its consequences. Her struggle centers on breaking free from this cycle, which she initially believes can only be ended by her death. As the story progresses, parallels between timelines and her relationships with characters like Vi and Ekko show her internal conflict, with Ekko ultimately preventing her from taking her own life, offering her hope and the possibility of a new beginning. Despite the destruction around her, including the looming Noxus-Piltovian war, Jinx's journey appears to be shifting towards finding a way to move forward, not by ending her life but by letting go of the past and forging a new path."
"Now, is Jinx actually dead? Oh, He moves right there. Coincidence? I think not. Welcome back everyone, It's Charlie Netflix just released Arcane Season 2, and it's probably going to go down as one of the greatest animated series of all time for a number of reasons. The overwhelming quality of the animation was so much better than anything else on TV, and even though they rushed through season two, it was a great storyline that at least tried to complete all the character arcs in the satisfying way. Also setting up at least three different sequel and spinoff League of Legends universe TV shows. and for those of you that are bummed about what happened to jinx, she is still alive. They gave us enough proof during the ending of the finale. I'll explain how she survived. So jinx will return in some of these sequels and spinoffs. But the bad news. You probably seen everyone talking about the past week since it came out is that Netflix canceled the show. Netflix canceled arcane before season two ever came out. It sounds crazy because it seems like the show was very successful for Netflix. Why would they cancel such a successful show? I'll explain what's going on behind the scenes, but the arcane showrunner Chris Link from riot, the company that makes League of Legends. They're also the ones that did all the work on the show, too. Just did an interview where he explains what's happening next, even though arcane itself is totally cooked like it's done. So we'll break it all down. if you're brand new to the channel, be sure to subscribe to get all the episodes. Here's his interview where he explains the future of what they're calling the League of Legends Cinematic universe. So yes, right now we're developing the follow up projects. you know, I mean, yeah, we're exploring a bunch of, directions. I mean, we when you work on something for nine years, like, it's pretty normal and pretty expected that you're going to have ideas for other stories. You know, there's many characters we all. I mean, like every league player, if you play the game for like 14 years, 15 years, you're not just going to you're going to have your phases where you fall in love with a certain champion. Right? And for us, it's like we can just look back and go like, oh, which one will be cool to get a story? So we're really going wide. We're looking at every region. And we really need to now have the ability to really focus on building, like, a slate to tell many more stories. Continue. Some of them. So, yeah, we're we're we're far from done, you know? I mean, this is right now a really exciting time for everyone, for us, because, we can finally, like, really focus, you know, on, like, okay, what's next? as he says there, riot who owns League of Legends, the game has already been developing at least three spinoffs and sequel stories. Most of which they set up during arcane season two. Some of you might have detected this during the episodes, where there were a few storylines that seemed like they were there to just set up sequels and spin offs. We'll talk about those in a second. But jinx is one of those characters. Like, her story is not over. They gave her an out at the end of the finale. I'll explain how that happened. but as the showrunner says, there are billions of different champions inside the League of Legends game. They're moving on to groups of other champions in different regions now, but it's going to take them a number of years to actually make those other new shows. It took them almost six years to make Arcane Season one. If you were aware. The showrunner in that clip that I use said that the idea for arcane came to him doing a show based on League of Legends Champions characters started in 2015, but they didn't announce the show publicly until 2019, after it's been in production for a little while and then released episodes in 2021. the reason why they were able to get season two out in three years, if it took so long to make season one, is because they were already working on season two when season one episodes were being released. so the fact that he's talking about these three spin offs right now means that they've already probably started working on them. They'll be at least three years before we see at least one of them. 20, 27, before that next sequel show comes out. So put a pin in that date. I know. The big question here is why would Netflix make them rush through their storyline? In two seasons of 18 episodes, when there were so many characters in the show, it feels like they skipped over a ton of stuff during season two in particular, just because they knew they had to end the show with the finale. They could have done at least four seasons, probably more than that. And even then it would have felt a little bit rushed. but after news of the cancellation started to come out, it was revealed that Arcane Cause, Netflix and Riot $250 million to make those 18 episodes of two seasons. That's right, $250 million making it the most expensive animated show of all time. Now it makes a little more sense why it looks so good. Because they spent so much money making it. for example, Deadpool and Wolverine, Spider-Man No Way Home, massive, massive Marvel movies both cost more, like $200 million. So arcane cost them more to make than these giant big Marvel movies. Netflix only earns money on these shows and movies through their subscriptions. They don't have an extra revenue stream. The studios get when they release big movies in theaters, then again on DVD, then license it to other streamers and cable networks. so when a studio releases a movie, even if it's a bit of a box office bomb, they have a way to make their money back on like a $200 million movie. But Netflix, the other streamers don't have a way to do that on streaming shows. here's the other kicker to this. The other side of this riot, the company that makes the League of Legends game mostly paid for arcane themselves out of pocket, and Netflix really only paid to license the show, along with a couple other streamers around the world that don't have Netflix in their countries. between all the money that riot earned on those licensing fees in the DVD they're selling for season one and season two, they are selling DVDs for both seasons. If you want to buy them. riot probably made less than $30 million of that back, maybe less than $50 million. So they burned through at least a solid $200 million of their own money that they're never going to get back on that. and this is the main reason why riot said that they wanted to cancel arcane so quickly and move to other regions inside the League of Legends animated universe. the larger reason Riot and Netflix are doing all this now, Riot Primarily because of the people that are paying for the show. For the most part. the reason why they don't care that the animated shows like arcane are loss leaders, they lose a ton of money on them, is because they're using the shows to drive more interest in the League of Legends video game, which they also own, which is where all their real money is actually earned. They earn ten times more money on the video games than studios do on their movies and TV shows. So riot makes way more money on the League of Legends game than they ever could on even like $1 billion hit movie or TV show if they ever did release any movies in theaters. what they're really trying to do now is continue to drive interest and get people into their games through more animated characters and champions from other regions like the showrunners said, there are billions of champions from different regions. We're just focusing on different groups now. so, even though it does suck that they're canceling arcane, they're still going to be doing animated League of Legends shows in this same connected universe, Marvel style, for a very long time. So this is not the end in a number of the arcane characters, like the means will return in those spinoffs. to tell many more stories. Continue. Some of them. Jinx is probably one of the best examples of that, because they seemingly ended her story on a cliffhanger, making it seem like she sacrificed herself to save by and tried one last time to reach Vander, who had been turned into the werewolf war break from the game They gave us all the clues we need to let us know that she survived the fall in the bomb without literally coming out and beating us over the face with it. Zoom in. Enhance here. Notice when she falls and her bomb goes off. This is what her bomb looks like. This is the color. Notice when it's exploding, there's a trace line of purple arcing towards the side of the frame. So remember that earlier in the episodes when they showed jinx moving very fast across the screen, they would animate her eyes glowing with the trail of purple across the screen. during the very end of the episode, VI is sulking, drowning in her cups, sad about jinx, and Caitlin is reading her family's archives about the Hex Gate, the place where they just were, where jinx disappeared and they did not find a body. So keep that in mind too. You know the rules. No body means no death. but when Caitlin is reading the schematics of the hex gate, notice how the cameras shifts and zooms in on the exhaust ports to the side. Caitlin's little rise smile. Here is her realizing that they didn't find a body because dot dot dot jinx escaped through one of those exhaust ports. So notice the arcane color of Jinx Jinxes eyes going towards one of the exhaust ports. When the bomb goes off. in this airship is meant to be jinx flying away from built over. That's why the credits when they roll. So jinx is fond when it says the end as an is meant to be a bit of more of a question mark. Is this really the end? Ella Purnell, who plays the jinx character, also released this teaser just recently for her being alive too. It was her way of winking at the camera saying the jinx is still around. Without full on spoiling this, she survived. Now, is Jinx actually dead? Oh, He moves right there. Coincidence? I think not. here's where we get to all the sequels and spin offs that that arcane showrunner confirmed there at least three that he mentioned. There could be more that they're working on, but only three that he talked about. There's a show set in boxes for Mel at the end of the finale. If it wasn't clear Mel is on, the NOx. The. And ships sailing back there with her mother's troops, which are now her troops. Notice that all the soldiers swore fealty to her Immedi after she killed her mother. So all of her family's holdings. The soldiers belong to her now. She was meant to come from a powerful family inside Knox's. You could say her entire storyline in season two was mostly dedicated to setting up that black Rose spinoff show, where the black Rose are the main villains, probably Le Blanc actually being the main antagonist. She helped form the black Rose organization in the first place, and she was the primary person that kept coming after Mel and her mother throughout the episodes. But if you haven't played the games. The black Rose is a secret society led by key members of the aristocracy from Knox's, that try to use a lot of statecraft and subterfuge in magic, for example, to guide history from the shadows. They're a little bit like the Bennet Jesuit order inside the Dune universe. The other part of that, too, is that riot recently announced that Mel is going to be a new playable champion inside League of Legends, where she was not a character from the games before. the second show they're working on now is set in Ionia is a sea base area provinces inside an archipelago of islands known as the first Lands. They didn't really get too deeply into this area during the arcane series, but some of the champions from that area include early master Yi Shen, Z. the third new show is set in De masia, which is the main hub of the entire region in League of Legends is a really big area with a ton of higher nobles. some of the big champions from that area are Fiora, Garen, kale. Lux. Now, they didn't say which of the shows would release first. They're probably just waiting to see how development goes on all three of them, and they'll just go with whichever story winds up being the strongest. They didn't say which show jinx is going to come back on or invite Caitlin. Some of the other characters will come back on that, too. My guess is they're mostly focused on like, jinx and a couple of the other characters in jinx might show up in cameos or crossovers in all of the different sequel shows. but like I said, their primary goal is just to introduce new regions of the game with a bunch of new champions. So everybody let me know in the comments which of the shows do you want them to do first, and which other characters do you want to see come back from the arcane series? I didn't do a ton of videos for season two episodes. So if you do have questions about the characters or what was going on, write them below in the comments and I'll try to answer them. There's a bunch of stuff coming up before the end of this year. And next year we have Dune Prophecy episodes, Skeleton crew episodes. I'm doing videos for What If season three episodes at the end of the year, so be sure to enable alerts for my channel so you don't miss any of that stuff. speaking of other video game universes, getting their own TV shows and movies, Henry Cavill working on that Warhammer TV series and movies, but apparently he's also going to be joining the Star Wars universe Click here to learn about","Netflix's Arcane Season 2, though praised for its animation quality, was rushed due to the cancellation of the show before its release, despite its success. The series, which cost $250 million to produce, was considered a loss for Netflix and Riot, who hoped to use the show to drive interest in the League of Legends game. Riot plans to continue the League of Legends cinematic universe with at least three spinoffs, focusing on different regions and champions. Jinx’s story, which appeared to end on a cliffhanger, hints at her survival and return in future projects. The planned spinoffs include shows set in Noxus, Ionia, and Demacia, with more characters and storylines to explore."
okay this has got to be the most epic fight scene entrance ever the first thing I love about this is just the phenomenon of a third player entering a 1V one that structure itself is just so juicy so awesome and there are a lot of iconic scenes where this happens but I specifically want to compare it to another favorite fight scene entrance of mine which is this [Music] I've always loved this entrance so much just because of how many aspects are geared towards expressing that this enemy is different we got all the little Blaster people and then there's the bomb bad Jedi and Sith who are just at a level above everyone else and they're going to be fighting in a way that powerfully expresses that and we have that reinforced by the change in music by the difference in wardrobe by the emotional tone of who this person is and by the reactions we'll handle this we'll take the long way it's the same thing with Jinx but in a much more abstract way that just blows my mind you think about ambessa and just what ambessa associates with strength she is all about the raw muscle and army stuff and the best military weapons and political Intrigue and that idea of power just short circuits when it's confronted by [Music] this it's like imagine an actual like room in general like you have Titus surveying this Bronze Age Battlefield Bronze Age Iron Age uh this classical antiquity battlefield full of horses and chariots and Spears and Shields and then out of nowhere rainbow bunny blimp blasting K-pop he would just lose his mind and you can see Essa taking this in and know that she just has zero understanding of what Jinx is and where her power comes from and just what type of power this is this degree of theatrics like Mel probably gets it but Essa only sees the fox and the Wolf she doesn't know about the bunny she doesn't know about the monkey the fox makes use of theatrics and Aesthetics as misdirection sometimes but Jinx is theatrics Aesthetics are a source of jinx power the wolf and the fox are creatures of discipline and control chaos monkey's power is the antithesis of control it finds where all order and Sensibility ends and igniting that into a big explosion is where the power comes from this structure of fights going from 1 V one to more than that it's just something I always love it creates this awesome feeling of expansion both in like a plot sense but also in a character sense what these characters represent who they are and usually gives you an appreciation for how big the world is the fact that we got science Nation versus Rome and then that's broken by like rainbow bunnies or we got good versus bad and that's split into the Sci-Fi Soldier people and the fantasy spiritual Warrior people so that's number one here number two is related its coolness if you seen my other season 2 Jinx videos you know that I'm just in awe of the magnitude of this quality the writers have given her in the season I gave a working definition of coolness in this video and that fits here too but still I'm going to use this scene to come up with a brand new definition just cuz why not try to advance my understanding of the concept more why not try to advance my understanding of the scene more so what is coolness well what do we see here first thing before we even get to our girl we see or really before we even see anything we hear this bad ass music bluring from the speakers and then we see this a gigantic chunk of just pure Jinx style and then we see Jinx herself heavily heavily decorated in Jinx style sitting surrounded by Jinx style everything so what we're getting first is an explosion of artistic self-expression which in and of itself isn't what cool is you can be cool without being artisty you can be cool without loud self-expression but that's where the other quality comes in the most standout feature of jinx that we've seen in this first image of her it's just how relaxed she is she is slouched there's nothing bothering her nothing scaring her there's nothing giving her any hesitation whatsoever about what she's about to do we see that same sentiment in her expression we see it in the way that she's literally sitting and letting the ship just not be steered at all but also she doesn't come off as apathetic she's not draped over the seat in like a sleepy way she's got the war paint on and we see her push herself to her feet and Saun her over to the helm if anything it's a similar energy she had during the fight in episode 3 she's ready she's ready to do what she's about to do she's ready to fight she's ready to die so I think the working definition of cool we can glean from this is earn confidence in who you are and what you're about if Jinx wasn't Jinx and we hadn't see her be Jinx in the most awesome fashion for the last season and a half if we hadn't seen what she could do if we hadn't borne witness to the fact that hex was not weaponized by a committee of old gry HR dingers it was done by a half craze super artsy teenage girl in her bedroom she started a freaking war on her own she surviv being Public Enemy Number One of piltover she basically can't die if we hadn't seen all that this wouldn't feel cool it would feel unearned it would feel pretty cringey to be honest but we have seen at all we know who she is and Jinx knows what she is she would not be leading this charge if she didn't know her capabilities and her talents and all that is on Full display here and it is so deserved she should feel this badass and just to be clear it's not just about what she can do it's about personality it's the substance of who she is that's when self- expression is cool when it comes from being confident in who you are and we kind of connect these things and that's part of what creates the coolness Jinx is this explosion of mad Artistry she's weird and loud and super artistic and super dramatic and super quirky and super crazy and super styish and super emotional super volatile and super silly and all of that feels like it's part of this machine that produces jinxin Jinx level intelligence Jinx level capability Jinx level strength so it's all of what she is that she's showing total confidence in that's what we be see in the super relaxed body language she knows she's strange but she's totally comfortable with that and speaking of body language does this SP should remind you of anything or anyone maybe someone else we saw sitting like this and being all cool to a similar badass hip-hop soundtrack so I don't think this is supposed to be loud in its similarity but I do think this is an intentional similarity because as on display as Jin's character expression is here in general this is new Jinx she was just in the deepest darkest depths we've ever seen her in and it was Ekko who pulled her out it was ekko's ideas she listened to it was his journey she was influenced by and that is something very new we've seen VI influence powder we've seen sille influence powder but we've never seen Echo influence powder what does that look like yeah it looks like this and there's a lot of nuance in how this new fire lady jinxin is all expressed it's a subtly more upbeat vibrant shift in her graffiti art style it's her new hip-hop soundtrack as we mentioned in place of what was was previously an emo pop punk alternative Sting soundtrack it's in this new super mobile super Airborne attack style Jinx is up high for the first time we've ever seen and speaking of which it's in the sunlight have we ever seen Jinx in broad daylight like this we have not a single Speck of jinxy creepy dark Dre at all and it's even in her hair like she goes from just loped off braids to this uh elegant child got a hold of Dad's razor cut and when I first saw this new hairstyle I thought it was pretty similar to VI and I think that is true but when I was studying the scene I realized this is also very echol like it has the vi punk rocker look B is a side shave with a longer in the middle Ekko is a shave all around with a longer in the middle so I think it's really jinx's tribute to both it's her fully living echo's influence and her fully living VI influence but really in a form that's her the purple lock as man pointed out that's a mix of her and VI colors it's also an homage to Felicia which also goes back to family both sisters together Etc but I love that what we're really seeing here is a blend of all Jinx identities we got the Ekko and vice stff but also Jinx is still sitting in the Jinx chair we got the bunny we got the monkey we got the garur monster hoodie we got our Milo and cler Dolls we got the clouds also purple now instead of blue and we still got all the classic Jinx Weaponry the minigun the rainbow explosions Fishbones and yes even the self-destruct grenade having the final stage of character development also be the broadest and most potent most all-encompassing most unified expression of character it's just so juicy it's so satisfying okay number four is the structure it's the setup the buildup it's where all the scene fits in functionally to the largest story of the battle I think they just did a super solid job with this it makes the whole thing better so think about what comes right before this it's two things we got this and we got this it's a very specific mix first with Maddy we have not just failure but betrayal and it's interesting thinking about the differences between those two things on an experiential level failure makes you feel like you're not enough but betrayal makes it personal it's not just you're not enough in a practical sense you are not worth Allegiance you are not worth trust you are not worth love you are just of minimal minimal worth I did appreciate your warmth failure is you not living up to the world betrayal is like the world is working against you it's not just being stabbed but it's twisting the knife but then following that we have this not just someone coming to save us but our former enemy coming to save us and look at that we got unexpected enemy followed by unexpected Ally very pretty opposites pouring salt on the wound followed by pouring sugar on the wound but yeah anyway it's very neatly done all the pain and not even being worth a basic level of trust gets this glorious upheaval of being worth all the trust in the world so much so that our number one enemy and the entire unders city is now on our side but then we have the male contrast too and yeah this is also very Darth Molly and besta our Conventional Weapons muscle woman is encountering Mel cool face markings Magic Woman that's almost exactly the Darth Maul situation except ambessa is ready to deal with magic but she is not ready to deal with chaos as we mentioned before which I think is also framed perfectly with the exchange she has with Mel right before this if you care for me at all spare their lives there is actually you know what the details don't even matter here it doesn't matter what's being said it's just the type of thing this is the place we're in with melan andessa is this whole abstract debate about political philosophy and ethics we got this whole esoteric symbolic terminology and just mood-wise it's really serious it's really tense like physically tense every character in play now is super high strung and super serious and then okay and I know we talked about this just like 30 seconds ago but just look at the posture tense tense tense and perfect ultimate cool person slouch H just a wonderfully potent contrast and we keep it up we go from solid static strength to Super mobile we go from this high philosophical discourse to ceva and Chuck and the rest of the unders City just smashing their way through because this is our dysfunctional mess of a city screw you it's that one Spider-Man [Music] scene for you take your fre I got some for your ass you mess with SPID you mess with New York you mess with one of us you mess with all of us abstract political ethical symbolism debate to Pure simple [ __ ] off energy it feels so good it's really how it should feel when you turn the tide of a battle it should feel different on this level of magnitude and this really goes to another favorite battle entrance scene of mine it's this [Music] one going from losing to winning should feel like the dawn it should feel like all the complex and anxious planning dissipates into a simple feeling what can men do against such Reckless hate ride out with me ride out and meet them the jinxing isn't just supposed to feel cool on its own it's supposed to feel strong as a turning point and it's just structured so perfectly as that okay but there's another type of Turning Point going on here and it's expressed most clearly in the music which we talked about peripherally but as we're kind of seeing more and more music is just such a major part of what makes the scene so comp each of the other four topics we talked about Jinx being different the coolness Echo influence Jinx and structure the music has played a big role in all of these I actually originally had a different fifth thing that I even recorded but the more I saw what a direct role the music was playing the more I had to delve into it directly and here's what I realize when you have a turning point like this you can't just think of it on a plot level,"The scene described highlights a powerful and unique entrance by Jinx in a battle, where her presence and confidence are central to the turning point of the conflict. The transition from a tense, philosophical atmosphere to a chaotic, unrestrained energy underscores Jinx's character development and newfound strength, influenced by both Vi and Ekko. Her entrance is marked by artistic self-expression and confident body language, symbolizing her evolution. This moment contrasts traditional strength with chaos, using music and visual style to emphasize Jinx's impact, marking her as a game-changing force and a memorable symbol of rebellion and transformation."
"I hate only JS I don't usually say I hate people but I would pay to slap the out of only JS while scrolling through my for you page and only js's life came up I feel like I just got hate cranked only JS is one of if not the most hated Creator on Tik Tok she has been a constant controversy magnet for the last few years and while none of these controversies were able to make her lose her audience overnight they've been slowly chipping away at her online reputation it's gotten to the point that the only people who talk about her now are the ones who hate her guts hi I'm the internet Anarchist I create weekly YouTube documentaries and today we'll be examining the satisfying downfall of only JS how a mixture of extreme racism blatant plagiarism and over-the-top reactions turned her into the punching bag of the Isabella ailla AKA only JS started her Tik Tok account back in 2018 she was working at Best Buy at the time and often recorded her videos without taking off the uniform when Best Buy found out they did not like it one bit resulting in her getting fired from her job I was working at Best Buy making videos of my uniform they found out about it not even at work like before work after work just in my uniform they found out about it told me to delete the videos or we're going to fire you so I deleted the videos and then they fired me they fired you anyway yeah they fired me anyway this gave her the push she needed to pursue social media fulltime and do everything she could to succeed at it during this time she started uploading fun fact and life hack videos that went super viral you tell which one of your friends likes who by just paying attention a little bit more if you're in a group and something funny happens or somebody tells a joke people tend to be laughing while looking at the person they like most the success of these videos was a massive boost for her Tik Tok allowing her to go from just over 100,000 followers in September of 2019 to 1 million followers just a month later and while her Tik Tok was doing numbers she also started a YouTube channel under the same name in October of 2019 and posted her first video titled God isn't real why he exists from there she continued posting a variety of videos like Vlogs and q&as but her most popular uploads with the video essays on topics such as hypnosis is real the meaning of life and where are the aliens the audience love the Deep yet entertaining discussion of these fascinating topics from only JS but hypnosis while it can be described as such is so much deeper than mind control it's real and it's not a hoax the future of hypnosis will be to fully realize the incredible potential of our natur hypnotic abilities it allows us to open up relax change laugh and it teaches us to have a little bit more fun with one commenter under this video writing please don't stop making these videos they are so interesting I love them what fans didn't know at the time was that these videos were hiding a terrible secret that ended up being a major reason behind only Jay's downfall we'll get back into this later in the video getting back to her rise on social media she also started posting her popular Tik toks on YouTube shorts after its launch in July of 2021 which directed even more people to a long form content on YouTube as well as her Tik Tok page and as if succeeding on both Tik Tok and YouTube wasn't enough she even got tied by Netflix to host a podcast called noit all in March of 2020 hey no alls remember my riddle from last episode what is somewhere we've already been and is not here shout it out on the count of 3 1 2 3 space and to top it off she even received a sponsorship from Tinder here are some easy tricks that might just get you more matches on Tinder but simply only Jays had everything a Tik tocker slashonline influencer could ever dream of but it didn't take long for her to lose at all fast forward to today and her career is at an all-time low her Tik Tok account is struggling to clear 100,000 views despite having over 18 million followers most of her recent YouTube videos have terrible lack to dislike ratios and people even created a petition for her to get banned from Tik Tok with over 447,000 signatures to date which begs the question what happened how did a Tik tocker who makes harmless life hack videos become the most hated person on the platform as I briefly mentioned earlier only Jace has been a constant controversy magnet for the last 3 years or so that said most of these controversies can be divided into two main categories the first of which is her extreme racism only JS has always presented herself as a wholesome and inclusive person and that's what a fans believed as well that is until February 2021 when Tik tocker freak the Gemini posted a video exposing her for the deeply disturbing messages she sent back in 2016 everybody here that I love you no matter your sex your gender your sexuality your faith or your race Goofer guess that didn't age well cuz this you at the bottom calling someone the hard e r a word used to oppress black people in my community the messages read you told yourself to grow up oh yeah totally going to high school college classes work and working 7 to 8 plus hours on YouTube is so not hard but grow up let your damn balls drop before you start talking to pop on the internet you bottomless pit of insecurity again auto correct you dumb and yes you're right the abortion didn't work which is why my parents hate me and why I've been in foster care for the past 2 years so congrats on that go f yourself you peace of I honestly hope your parents get cancer I hope everyone you love dies and most of all I hope Trump gets shot so OD D self gets to live in a world with Clinton as president while all of these messages were extremely inappropriate and disturbing they would pale in comparison to her last message which read I'm done talking to a heart are loving ads hole have fun with sucking these messages were allegedly directed at another white Creator who was dating a black person at the time so instead of using the nword with a hard art as an insult she tried to insult the person for loving a black person which some might argue is even worse here's the thing she didn't just say the n-word it's not like she was mouthing it and said the words in a song There are levels to it there's the white influencer dancing and then mouthing the words with an a at the end there's calling someone the nword there's calling someone the n-word with a hard r at the end and then there's calling someone a n a slur is a slur but to insult someone for being in a relationship with a black person by calling them a n lover it does not get any worse than that admittedly these messages were from 2016 back when she was 17 years old so she still had the opportunity to own up to a mistake make a sincere apology and vow to never repeat this mistake again only JS however decided it would be best to make a corporate apology with Hollow promises and clearly fake tears in my past I said disgusting things to people and I am so ashamed of myself for using racist rhetoric and atory language to hurt others because I knew what that word meant and I understood the power behind it but I said it anyway because it was the meanest thing that I could think of and I am so sorry to everyone but especially to those in the black community because only you guys can forgive me for this and there is no excuse and there are no justifications for what I said and you guys deserve better some people did try to defend her like this one person who wrote you asked for an apology you got an apology take the apology most saw this whole thing as fake and insincere with one comment stating this is so upsetting I want to believe she's a good person since I like her content because she has reflected anti-racist rhetoric in past Tik toks but she just keeps digging her grave deeper and deeper first she takes a long time to respond to this problem then she thinks she can redeem herself by following lots of black creators and then she makes a response video that looks really quickly thrown together it's also clear that she hasn't been crying but rather that's the face of someone who's been having a panic attack that leaves me to believe she is more worried about her follow account SL poopity rather than her quality as a person she's panicking to save her Spotlight but she's doing all the wrong things hopefully she can take a step back and address this properly after she's cleared her head because I want to see some more of her content other creators on Tik Tok were also calling her out for trying to seem like she was deeply hurt and crang dur in the video everything I hated about only J is apology number first is the fake crime crying I don't know what Miss little thing thing thought she was doing but she was like like she was crying when we all know she wasn't stop put simply the whole apology was completely rejected by the internet making more videos crying on camera and pleading for forgiveness would have only made the situation worse and only JS knew about this so instead she tried to show her audience that she was improving as a person the first book that I decided to pick up was how to be anti-racist by Dr ibram kendi and this will push readers that think that they're not racist into being something better regardless of her intentions this came off as extremely performative with even Charlie mocking her for posting this video you need to buy a book on how not to be racist you've already failed I think you're already too far gone however despite the public ridicule she still had one last chance to redeem herself you see near the end of her apology she promised to collab with more black creators on Tik Tok as a way to raise awareness on the issue of racism so I want to take this time to take a step back and share my platform with some amazing black creators who are going to tell their story to try and educate others on the trauma that happens when we use this kind of language after watching this a black Tik tocker by the name of Aunt Karen zero reached out to only JS and the two agreed to post videos together in the upcoming days however days turned into weeks and the collab video never got uploaded leaving fans nothing but confused well as it turns out only Jus failed to follow through on her end of the bargain despite making such a big deal out of this in her apology this made Aunt Karen feel like she was just used for attention then tossed aside when the controversy lost steam after getting fed up with the situation she posted a series of videos on her Tik Tok publicly calling out only Jus on her behavior so this message is for you only Jus now you become a mutual of mine after your whole nword debacle said you want to collaborate with me we email and suddenly you've dropped off the face of the Earth so are black people just tokens for you to use when you're ready to play because I can tell you one thing if you were really truly sorry about what you said you would not have lied and said you were going to do something you clearly aren't trying to do these videos were quickly eroding the little credibility only Jays had left with her audience but just like before she still had the opportunity to admit her mistake and show that she meant it by doing the right thing only JS however had a better idea to go on a rage fi rant and blame everything on her ADHD while taking zero responsibility for not following through on her promise what are people mad at me for now not checking my emails in a timely manner I wish I was joking I forgot to respond to an email from this creator that wanted collab with me and you know instead of just like hitting me up again they made seven videos about it can you please leave me the alone I have a diagnosed neurological disorder that makes me forget things and procrastinate due to time blindness I forget to eat for days I procrastinate sleep for more days I barely text my family back and I just had to move Apartments because my address got leaked and you're going to throw a fit because I didn't make you my priority but this wasn't even the end of the controversy the thing is people always suspected that only Jay's apology was scripted that much was clear but here's where it gets insane Isabella didn't even write her own apology instead it was Ghost written by a Tik Tok user I'm just Xander who later posted a video exposing her lies have someone ghost write their apologies so that they didn't lose their brand deals the person that helped you write the apology is me hi I already talked about it once before on my channel but immediately after they confirmed it was true with me over text message I then tried to help them to to the best of my ability while still being extremely angry and frustrated helped with a good bit of the apology especially the part about black creatives when we were both talking about that part in the apology I really did think that they would hold up there into the bargain you know by this point the backlash against only Jus reached even the most secluded corners of the internet both Netflix and","Only JS, a controversial TikTok creator, gained fame in 2018 but has faced a steady decline in popularity due to multiple scandals, especially around her racist behavior. Initially rising through viral life hack videos, she was fired from Best Buy, which pushed her into full-time content creation. However, her online career was marred by a 2016 racist message leak, prompting a failed public apology deemed insincere. Her efforts to atone, such as promising collaborations with black creators, fell apart when she failed to follow through, further damaging her reputation. Despite initial support, her actions, including blaming ADHD for her shortcomings and a ghostwritten apology, have left her with a tarnished image and a petition for her removal from TikTok."
I told you to stay away can you forgive a monster you're a jinx do you hear me Milo was right for me that's such an understandable way that somebody's psyche could begin to fracture silco thanks he made Jinx but he didn't you did I would actually disagree with Jinx on that I think that it went even further back I think VI's completely changed sides so she's actually become the thing she hated at the very beginning Jinx feels like a girl who is beaten down by an identity that she is given by other people until the point where she can no longer fight it so I'm done I stop resisting welcome back everybody to frame of mind where psychology and film making meet at the intersection of Storytelling my name is Jordan I'm a video editor my name is Curtis I'm a psychotherapist a lot of you have been waiting for this one this is probably our most requested Episode by far one of them I think certainly by the number of suggestions and also by far if you just go by the polls that we've done asking you guys what your favorite franchises are we're talking about Arcane yes finally something where we're actually timing it right where're hopefully like there's a discussion season 2 is coming out people are talking about it so we wanted to really get into this because this is not my first time watching this but this is your first time watching this and I think this might be one that we really like and I think a lot of other people like it too and I think for very good reason so it makes it awesome to talk about and this it was such a weird experience for me I didn't like it at first oh okay yeah so the very first episode I watched probably 24 hours after watching a silent voice oh that's right that's right very different emotional uh uh stuff going on there yeah you hadn't cleansed your palette yet if you want to see a silent voice let us know that's another one that's definitely been requested but yeah I had a hard time watching it at first I think episode one I was like H episode two was like like whatever episode three I was like oh this is going to be good oh interesting yeah something about it stood out for you then as soon as episodes three hit I could sort of put the pieces together of like oh this is what they're building up to oh they they're really taking their audience on a very well-crafted Journey it just took a little bit to get there it was strong it was thematically good but I didn't really see how good it was until episode 3 interesting I think when I watched it was when it first came out back in 2021 so I was picking up the first episode I think I liked it right from the very beginning I'll be really curious to look and see when it was in episode 3 that felt for you like it turned a corner there was a moment yeah whatever that moment was I'm going to be super interested to see what that was mhm as soon as I got about like halfway through this series I just realized that it was basically the perfect episode for us to talk about because it's basically just contrast the show you know in a lot of ways yeah absolutely it's it's like uh you got older sister versus younger sister you got red versus blue you got upper class versus lower class uh piltover versus Z you've got a good father figure in Vander you got a bad father figure in Silo you got a good Mentor in uh in heerding you got a bad Mentor in uh in what's his name singed then there's this idea about like don't go too fast you have to take things slow toward us in the hair it's like we got to progress forwards and then there's even stuff like the um the 2D versus 3D animation contrast is just baked into the story Into the visuals into the characters it's everywhere and it just makes it so beautiful I love it it's interesting too cuz it feels like that contrast and the differences between characters is really what drives a lot of the plot forward yeah this to me feels very much like a you would call it a character driven narrative yes this is lots of you have different people who are all trying to coexist in the same space yes but they have different values they have different motives and it's when those values and motives come into conflict with one another that that's what progresses the story forwards yes and I think there's something about when you construct a narrative that way it makes it a little bit more uh I don't know if it's interesting or immersive than when you just structure a story where this happens and this happens and this happens this happens and these characters just kind of follow the train tracks and just go with the narrative it's like it feels more I think you would say like authentic and organic because it's like oh I believe that each of these characters would do the things they would do yes because you presented me with their values what's important to them what they struggle with and then you put them in front of a problem it's like well obviously yes that makes sense with what they would do then what that character does tracks with who You' told me that they [Music] are what I found super interesting about this scene here at the very beginning is that first of all it's thematic it starts on a bridge and then later on Jinx will have this moment on a bridge where she kind of comes around full circle yeah one of the many examples that we'll see of foreshadowing and things being mirrored and returns to Old spaces yes but what found really lovely about this was I didn't catch this the first time that I that I watched this but the the coloring is red this is all red yep and as much as this impacts both VI and Jinx this is really vai's character develop moment here yeah the L parents yeah yeah everything because you can see that like you know powder's impacted whatever but this is where you see VI really lose it at losing her mother this is where she sees Vander she's going to be mod her future self after Vander she's going to become the like this is subtly kind of showing you that we haven't even been introduced to these characters color schemes yet but all throughout this is consistently going to be showing you just in one color choice that this is VI's character development moment this is impacting her yeah it's interesting to me when like they have that moment where they see their parents yeah and it's VI looks at her parents and starts crying and powder looks at VI yeah oh and it's fascinating to to how there's like a a moment where she's almost trying to take care of her right of like let me Comfort my big sister let me try to support her and I love this piece where like Vander drops the gauntlets literally yeah in order to take up a mantle of a new role right because this is where he goes from fighter to father that's a good yeah it's a good this is where he's moving from this position of instead of me trying to protect by hurting the people on the other side it's time for me to turn back to the people who are in my care and to be responsible for them yeah he's almost got like the energy of Thors yep in a lot of ways absolutely it's not a one for one but it's like I'm going to choose the non-violent route despite my entire history being one of violence he's got the same like archetype the warrior laying down his swords but specifically the warrior laying down his swords to become a caretaker for the Next Generation yeah cuz in both cases for Thor's and better they've now got kids that they're responsible for which means they have to put down the mantle of violence to take on the mantle of [Music] fatherhood there's a shot here that I thought was really interesting where VI looks at this enforcer and you can see like she's scowling it's like how dare you and it's so fascinating that this comes full circle because she basically becomes an enforcer yeah her teaming up with Caitlyn is the I'm assuming going into season two um and the fact that in I did a little bit of research into uh lol's lore where uh VI the character in the game is she is on the enforcer side yeah so I'm assuming in season two we're going to see that transition kind of fully take hold and even when she teams up with Jace towards the end right there's like that she's kind of with pilt over side because she needs to do the things that she wants to to get back at silco to she's trying to make transformation in the unders City at the very least she's symbolically changed sides to the point where the person that she scalled at has now become her yeah which is fascinating then when you bring that up you think about jinx's last words to VI H you've changed you've changed too yeah maybe you could love me like you used to even though I'm different but you change too and it's like okay but how has she changed cuz she still wants to to you know take care of her she still cares for her a lot but it's like you switch sides yeah you're on this side now you're the one who's over here and it kind of is this this divide which is interesting too in this scene because it feels like with this this scy in this moment where Vander and the kids are going to one side and the enforcers go to the other side but there's still this facial expression for Vi yeah it really emphasizes to me this idea of we're starting the series with a tenuous piece yes like we've decided to both go to our own sides and do our own thing and we're not going to be in direct conflict but we're still not happy with each other yeah we're still like there's this underlying tension that's showing up yes potent throughout the entire show y um what do you think about the art style I really like it yeah there's something about it that feels like the I think the primary thing that I like about the art style is how it facilitates character emoting yes yeah I think I know what you mean but keep going what do you mean by that the idea of like even like Vice facial expression here and so many other characters facial expressions throughout the show you're going to be able to perceive emotions on their face and know what they're feeling without them saying anything yes which is so valuable I think in a world where we come from yeah nothing there was no dialogue in this scene there was powder singing at the beginning which again is mirrored when she comes back to the bridge you know at the of the Season anyways there was no dialogue in this opening it was just facial expression action visuals done yep so which is great cuz I feel like the the animation style lends itself to both the action oriented pieces where you can do things that you couldn't do in live action yes but it also lends itself to an emoting and a subtleness that can sometimes be hard to do in animation yes and so they really have this nice kind of Blended space where they can accomplish both and I think there's something that I mean first of all it's fascinating because when you look at the behind the scenes pieces to know that the forti the the studio who animates this MH they essentially use no motion capture really every single thing is hand rigged that's awesome and so there's something about like you would think you see this so much in in video games and animated shows now where people will have the the facial trackers yeah that they'll do the bodysuit yeah the bodysuit with the camera in front of them and they'll have all the dots in their face so they can track all the facial motions they can capture it that way yeah so people don't who don't know will understand like the reason they do that is because it is so much more time efficient to have a base capture of what is your character doing and then tweak it and smooth it out and amplify the ways that you want to molding something that's pre-existing is way more time efficient than doing something from scratch is basically the reason but apparently that is what they did here so they took the more time intensive route to get the exact look and style they wanted yeah where it's all got this like handcrafted feel to it and there's it's interesting too because from the from the background uh videos what it looks like they did is they use tons of reference footage that's cool so like the animators will go and physically do the Motions that they want to do and record themselves doing it and then they'll come back and have the video playing in front of them and then go and say okay now how do I rig the face so that it looks like that oh I see H which I mean yeah it's probably more time consuming not sufficient but there's something cool too about the idea of you talk about people feeling the passion there was an interesting thing where they were talking about how like you would walk through the office at fortish and you would see animators at their desk rigging somebody's face and the animators would be like no that's so they're like kind of feeling it themselves like how do I get like this cuz when I did this and I feel this I want to make it look like that and there's almost something about the the when the animator is not trying to replicate something but embodying it yes when it's not an actor giving the performance but it's an animator giving the,
say on three ready yeah 1 2 3 amazing you know and then he totally serves you know he's like yeah yeah I'll let you out cuz cuz you mess with my home girl but just know I'm on your case you know there you go thank you're eating I mean man what a way to start season 2 right are VI and Caitlyn really going to split for real what's ambessa Planet who or or what was that thing hanging in the back of the Doctor's lab creepy you know the real question I mean what in the world happened to Jace Heimerdinger and me Echo I mean who's going to clean all of jinx's paint off the council building cuz it's not going to be me or Vander Vander Vander or himer Dinger himer all day himer Dinger or Jay himer Jace is cool but himer Dinger or Mel I think that's Mel I feel bad that I even had to think about

protagonist yeah okay so I feel like I know what's going on here I think someone has a thing for zoka uh we had a lot of fun we had a lot of fun reading it no no feelings were hurt at all in the reading of these letters nope,"In this discussion, the hosts analyze the complex character dynamics and themes in *Arcane*, highlighting contrasts such as older versus younger siblings, good versus bad mentors, and socio-economic divides. They reflect on the psychological depth of characters like Vi and Jinx, focusing on their evolving identities and relationships, particularly Vi's transition from rebellion to aligning with Piltover. They also appreciate the show's visual storytelling, with its subtle color choices and emotive facial expressions that enhance character development. The conversation delves into the show's narrative-driven structure, driven by the characters' motives, values, and conflicts, while also noting the unique hand-crafted animation style that enhances both action and emotional moments."
Isa is a character that's been picked apart to death by the Arcane community and I'd like to step over her lifeless body and add to the beating so it's no secret that Isa is similar to powder in her baby form firstly both Isa and powder are introduced in the exact same way they both have to make a big jump and they both fail to do so in one case it's VI saving powder very intentionally in the other it's Jinx saving Isa unintentionally and this parallel sets up the difference in Dynamics between both their relationships as older sisters Jinx keeps unintentionally helping and inspiring Isha through her revolutionary acts through her inability to defend herself and VI kept inspiring powder through intentional acts coming towards her saying you're good enough it's okay that you made a mistake and we see after the first few episodes with Isa that she transforms from her own independent character into a basically a jinx wannabe this comes through in both her design change where she goes from her yellowish theme with her eyes and her legs to being full out a jinx clone and the yellow is no longer his present on her outfit similarly the very first time we see Isa with Jinx together after the time skip in episode 4 we see Isa with bunny ears the bunny in season 1 was representative of powder's childhood and her innocence it was given to her by Vi in the same way that VI protected her and made it okay for her to still be a child even after the death of her parents but it was also taken away from her when she smacked her and it smacked out of her hands she lost her innocence from V too because you know and the big obvious parallel between Isa and powder is that they look like they're the same age not only that but Isa has goggles which looks like clager mean her design has a strong connection to jinx's past continuing with the design cues she's wearing a Minor's helmet now this is the same Minor's helmet that we see Vian powder's parents wearing in their flashback meaning that she was likely just working in the mines for Crow and to that extent it makes total sense why Jinx who represents freedom for the unders City would mean so much for her cuz she's doing child labor in the mine another parallel between them is that they had this big desire to be involved in whatever was going on around them now for powder that meant getting involved in the gangs activities striking back at piltover and similarly for Isa Street kid from Z she wanted to get involved in the revolution that was gunting back at her also getting back at piltover but a huge difference in how this comes out is the difference in their parenting VI was very protective intentionality she didn't want powder getting involved in things that could actually get her hurt whereas Jinx let Isa do whatever she wanted and several times we see herself throw herself into situations where she can get hurt very easily this pairs especially well with their character cuz both Jinx and Isa have basically no sense of self-preservation now for Jinx VI was that sense of self-preservation she preserved her for her but since Jinx is not doing that for Isha we see it come out hold up hold up hold up hold up what do you mean Jinx doesn't have a self-preservation nature well let's look at what she does the way she fights is very Reckless and we've seen her three different times trying to kill herself she had tried to kill herself with Echo she tried to kill herself with by and she tried to kill herself again with Vander smile and she was only stopped each time by circumstance or other people intervening and of course as powder she was following the gang into situations which she was not equipped for how does this show show that isa's got her life to blow non-preservation Instinct also like And subscribe while I'm here specifically her helmet you may not have noticed it but her helmet is always falling off whenever she runs after Jinx and there's a very specific reason for this the helmet represents protection her ability to protect and then her lack thereof in when she puts in these situations so when she first meets Jinx she runs after her the helmet falls off that's alluding to the fact that she's going to be vulnerable around Jinx first we see her running away from goons she's taking a care of herself the helmet is on then she takes a big leap it falls off because she's vulnerable Jinx could shoot her here she might die but no Jinx protects her and puts the helmet back on her indicating that she's sick she tries to chase after her and the helmet falls off giving a little foreshadowing that she's not going to be fully safe being around Jin so for example next time it comes off is when she throws herself in between Jinx and fie and she's been very vulnerable here she's not at all safe in this situation and because of this act of closeness we see that after the time skip in season 2 Act 2 she doesn't have it basically at all around Jinx in fact it goes the complete opposite way she has the bunny ears which as we've seen indicates her emotional closeness with jinx she decorates her helmet meaning the identity she wants to protect is jinx and of course her helmet falls off when she gets hit by Vi thank you for the child abuse by the way good to see that Jace isn't the only one Speaking of which didn't he murder another child in this act what is he doing man and her helmet falls off when she's getting jinx's gun right before her final big sacrifice roll that back what do I mean by the identity she wants to protect his Jinx so it's actually not just Jinx the person herself that she wants to protect but what it represents to the entirety of on we see her throwing up the power symbol to the mural of jinx this one little shot here tells us everything we need to know about how her character has changed into idolizing Jinx ever since the time skip she's wearing jinx's colors her legging she's covering her own face and thus her own identity and she's holding up a power symbol indicating her reverence for revolution in the Montage there's even literally a jinx monkey right on top of her face they're basically saying hey her identity is based on Jinx she even goes out and acts like Jinx because it's not just Jinx that she loves she loves what she represents and that brings us to her death scene why does she do this well there's four different ways to answer this question psychologically motivationally writing and her pattern so when I was a kid I used to argue with other kids who had different politics than my parents because I already thought I knew everything about the world that there was to know and I was righteous I thought everything I didn't know was evil Isa is at that age she still has that kind of All or Nothing mentalities on these different ideologies she can't see that oh piltover people are hurt and the zon people are hurt they're both hurt but she's there and she's 100% into causes she doesn't fully understand just like powder was when she wanted to help with the gang's escapades she didn't really understand what the crime meant but they both wanted to strike back at pilt another pretty common fantasy amongst younger people is one of wanting to sacrifice themselves I used to always have a fantasy about saving the school from a school shooter and that was a fantasy that almost everybody around me also had when I talked to them about it is basically making that ultimate sacrifice here this is the perfect opportunity to make my life just a small kid from the unders City means something and so in that moment she feels like sacrificing herself is the greatest good that she can do let's talk about her motivation so obviously she loves Jinx and we're going to get to that but she also loves what Jinx represents cuz Jinx isn't just Jinx anymore she's hope hope for the entire unders City she's hoped for Freedom she's hoped for Independence and funnily enough Isa may not realiz this but Isha is hope for Jinx Isa represents the hope that Jinx has in terms of life now when they're introduced there's the song that [Music] plays de but after that Isa introduces her back to having hope for a good life for not being dead inside but back to my main point she's not just sacrificing herself for Jinx but she's sacrificing herself for what Jinx represents to her plot-wise see Jinx couldn't just go from being a traumatized teenager with BPD to this zany fun lovable person like she is in league or whoever they decide to make her in her final form for act three she needed a catalyst for that and Isa representing powder representing her child's self that she reconnects with and then subsequently loses is the Catalyst that is needed for Jinx to become her adult self that we are going to see in season 2 act three finally isa's pattern Isa sacrificing herself has been teased before in the show not just from how she's thrown herself sacrificially to protect Jinx several times it was also teased by ambessa I've discovered a fourth principle sacrifice indicating that one of the four Pillars of Strength was sacrifice what does Isa have in droves it's sacrifice but focusing back on her pattern she's seen over and over again jinx's destructive impulses how many times how she's tried to kill herself how she tried to let herself die with VI how she's thrown herself into fights that she couldn't win like with Vander or with Rus and when Vander was acting up in the commune who was the first person to step in front of him to defend him it was Isa I think it's amazing that this small child thinks that this giant monstrous Beast needs defending but that's her mindset that's the mindset that she's in she's always concerned with protecting and in that sense anisha's mind for all she knows Jinx is just going to lay down there again and let herself die we see her laying on the floor and Isa sees that and she's seen this pattern before she knows that Jinx has this tendency to just want to give up especially when she's going through such an emotional time the time she saw her give up was with her family with VI beating her down and what is she losing right now her family again in the form of Vander and on the other side Isha she's always jumping in protect the very first thing we see her do is take a huge leap of faith on her own unlike powder who needed V to do it we also see her stopping Jinx from throwing away stink her Beetle that she worked very hard to decorate but she was just going to throw it away just like we've seen her try to throw away her life isa's been here before she knows this pattern for all of these reasons she decided to go and sacrifice herself for Jinx and the disgusting truth about Isa is that she was always going to do this she existed to push Jinx into her final form for act three she was always going to be her Catalyst anyways that's what I got for yall today like And subscribe throw me some money on patreon if you want goodbye,"Isa's character in *Arcane* parallels Powder’s journey, both being introduced through failed attempts to make a significant leap, with Isa unintentionally saved by Jinx, contrasting Vi’s more intentional care for Powder. Over time, Isa transforms from an independent character to a Jinx clone, symbolized by her design and emotional connection to Jinx, signified by elements like her bunny ears and helmet, which represent protection and vulnerability. Isa’s reckless self-sacrifice mirrors Jinx's own destructive tendencies, and her death serves as a catalyst for Jinx's growth, pushing her toward the adult version seen later. Isa’s actions reflect her ideological commitment to Jinx, embodying the hope and sacrifice that will shape Jinx’s evolution."

my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cereso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and get your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to the bowl i'm gonna infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chilli's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that make sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated it tastes really fishy you've got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really sumptuous rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day whether it's breads cakes tarts pies or pastries bacon is one of the most seductive skills in the kitchen it fills the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catching needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with the oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission star establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive getting to grips with bacon is just a matter of confidence slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouthwateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so,"The transcript details the preparation of several dishes, starting with a stuffed roast chicken using chorizo, cannellini beans, tomatoes, and

some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier [Music] this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken [Music] with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first [Music] salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked [Music] make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there [Music] now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavour on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] so smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated piles and cheese give your veg some attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is new york cheesecake because it's baked it says no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate [Music] the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] you,"The video demonstrates how to prepare quick and delicious Asian-inspired rice noodle

"in every Michelin Star Kitchen there's a foundation every Chef is taught to master these techniques have influenced modern cuisine around the world more than any other developed by Augusto scoffier these sources aren't just recipes they're the basis for experimentation and Innovation these are the five mother sources every Chef needs to master this is the book that most people get when they go to college as a foundations for French cooking and it covers the five basic mother sources it basically means there's five different basic sources which you can use for different types of recipes and different types of variations scoffier was a notable Chef in France who used to cook for Royals very influential he didn't just come up with this book which is like over 7,000 recipes he also came up with the principles of the French kitchen it was mirrored on the French military system so Chef dep party all the way up to head chef so First Source bashal in his book this is one of the mother sources because there's so many different things you can do with a bashal get this milk warm he says to add an onion studded with cloves to add a different Aroma the key principle of a bashal is it starts with a r and it's a milk-based sauce so there's a point of difference between a bashal and other sauces normally the other sauces contain stock but this is basically just a r with a flavored milk so the bamal sauce Rumor Has It historically was uh created for Louis the 14th bringing up this butter to like a light nuttiness roughly speaking it's almost equal parts butter to flour Co and you can start to see where it turns starts to turn all golden and that's just the milk solids turning um turning that color so add your flour now and allow that to cook out turn the heat right down otherwise you'll burn it and then the consistency that I was always trained to look for is it's almost should look like wet sand I think it's a a nice way to saying it but it does kind of it does kind of make sense froy and foamy and also a little bit golden always add warm milk to a bashal and I think that's where a lot of people go wrong with bashal you'll notice that like we're not slicing the onion up so it's actually a very sort of delicate way to flavor up the milk it's not like loads of slices of onion so it's like tastes like stewed onion and then all of that lightly season the milk cuz it cooked if you're adding a cold liquid into that sauce what can happen is it'll coagulate way too much um and then it'll take time to bring it back up to the right temperature and then that sauce will get too thick so I've added all of the milk at the same time it wouldn't cook out nicely and you'd get these like massive lumps and what happens is when I'm doing it like this the friction of beating it together gets rid rid of those lumps and then you can keep adding little bits of milk until it's the right consistency if you wanted to just make a white sauce which we traditionally serve with Christmas pudding in the UK you remove the onions and you'd have add a little bit of nutmeg or if you wanted to make a a mouret sauce then once this is cooked out properly then you add in your cheese and that would be used to make a lasagna or something like that this probably been about 5 minutes and what you got this beautiful consistency quite thick and Rich and glossy but you can also see those lightly brown little bits of butter in there as well but what we're going to do is quickly turn this into a a sawu beast it's really simple I've sweated down some onions without any color so they always talk about with a bashal uh line in the back of a spoon and what does that exactly mean when I trace my finger through it the line that goes through is perfectly left inside the sauce so suis is just one of the variations of a bashal so just blending up the bashal with the onions the onions are basically all they're going to do to that is just add this really nice sweetness they're not going to break down fully because they're not properly caramelized so I'm just passing it for a fine shiv into a into the same pan that I used before okay so this is our subis so I just whack it into a pan small amount of um your subie sauce little bit of leak oil on there now just a nice bit of salmon nice and crispy very simple it's not going to overpower any sort of flavor uh you could add lots of different things to that fresh ches at the end maybe you could even add a splash of white wine into the base number one of mother sauces bashal right next source so we're going to do a volut now so a volut has actually got very similar principles to a bashal it starts with a room probably my favorite of the foundational sauces because it's the most versatile whereas Bal is using milk here you're using St you're not really reliant on the butter flavor like you are in a bashal you're more reliant on the flavor of your stock or whatever you're finishing your Volute with so same ratio you've got in the with the bashel it should still look a little bit like wet sand but just a little bit lighter in color than a bashal what I've got here is just white chicken stock two different types of stock white chicken stock or brown chicken stock white chicken stock just means that I've not roasted the bones a much more delicate flavor the term valute comes from the French velour which essentially means velvet and that's quite a large part of what this sauce is I mean it it it's if when done properly it's an incredibly smooth sauce and it can look really really elegant on a plate so all I'm doing is just adding stock bit by bit just like with the bashal what I want is I want something that lines the back of the spoon so it's got a nice body to it but at the same time it's not too claggy and it's got that stunning velvety texture you could easily turn this into a mustard Volute add a bit of mustard and serve it with a chicken breast okay so perfect we've got here is finished voluto super shiny and glossy on the back of the spoon still leaves a trace I've just added a little bit of salt I'm going to turn this into a herb green sauce return it bright green with a bit of spinach which I'll just blanch first to release the chlorophyll and a tablespoon of mustard easy peasy okay so to finish this valute really simply what I'm going to do some spinach to a pan and blanch it all you're doing is just look to release the chlorophyll we'll take that out some herb so I've got some parsley and I'm just going to pick some taragan as well so all onto the same board so a couple of chops and then that can all just go into blanch as well so there's a few more stalks inside the uh the herbs so just they'll just need to be cooked up slightly longer than you would the spinach and then these can go into the ice as well you could use this as the base for a really beautiful fish pie or just a nice fish dish and just squeeze all of the excess moisture out of there can be quite liberal with the herbs cuz it literally does go down to absolutely nothing perfect so that's all our taragan parsley spinach mix in there the Volute goes on top so mix is just a high power blender so got this beautiful bright green herb Volute just going to finish that with a little bit of mustard that's been blitzing for about 2 minutes to be honest the thermom mix is a really good bit of kit but I've had just a sort of similar uh similar outcomes with a neutri buet at home so once you've added the mustard in there that's going to be basically a form of acidity so typically what you do in restaurants is you'll make the base sauce which is the best the herb bashal and then you'll acidulate it to order so you'll add a little bit of uh vinegar just before you send it acid in the vinegar gets rid of all the greenness out of the sauce so best served with some sort of white protein cuz it's a nice green sauce I've just got a nice chicken breast here and then just start from the center chicken goes on you could serve that with wilted spinach or anything like that tiny little bit of truffle oil a proper solid dish but that is just sauce and protein super easy foundational sauce okay number three Espagnol actually didn't originate in Spain it's a French sauce basically it just means Spanish in French essentially this is just a meat-based sauce it could be very versatile first in the pan is bacon then you're going to add a miror p to that we've got some celery we're just going to really nicely and very finely chop up so miror is just terminology for celery onion carrot vegetable combination in France much as the Italians have safo so dicing up your vegetables we'll just do half a white onion as well so we got this beautiful foam in bacon at the moment diced onions goes in and then the moisture from the onions is going to almost Del glaze the pan the reason you're adding all of these different aromat and vegetables is just essentially for sugar so you want to cook them down and you can see that we had that bacon fat on the bottom of the pan and now that's all been rendered away so now what we're going to do is just add a tiny a little bit of color to these onions add in the rest of our vegetables and then we'll proceed to add in our thickener which is in this case a r Okay so we've added a little bit of color to those onions and most of the residual waterers sort of disappeared now so I'm just going to add in the rest of the vegetables so in terms of this sauce this is the base for a lot of other sauces say a bord la which has got like mushrooms a little bit of bow marrow in there and then something like a chicken shash chasser something like a a Dian sauce so it it can be the base of a demig glass as well so once all of those vegetables have softened just going to add in the butter but I'm not going to go crazy cuz I've got a nice a nice beef stock here to allow that to sweat off so once our Butters melted I added about 50 g I'm just going to add just under that in flour cook that out slightly okay so that's cooked out lightly and now I'm just going to add my beef stock so I've got a nice Rich beef stock that we use in the restaurant if you're doing this at home you could always just use some stock cubes release most of the sauce from the bottom of the pan just make sure there's absolutely nothing by way of fond left of the bottom just reduce the the heat right down now what you want to do is cook this for a long time in order to get rid of any sort of flour that's left in there but also so that the vegetables can release all of the sweetness as well so it's slightly different to to what we were doing with the other sources with a sauce like this it's really difficult because there's different levels of Sweetness in different types of vegetables and that can change depending on season and a sauce like an Espagnol will take a lot more adjusting than just uh the bashal or a valute when you hear about a Sauer being one of the most important positions in the kitchen I think that's because if you take shortcuts in a in a sauce say you over roast the vegetables or you don't take time to take the fond off the bottom of the pan or any of those little steps you can taste that in the final sauce SAU will always always be tasting their sauce all the way through not just at the end this has been simmering now for about 15 minutes and you can see what's happened the the sauce is reducing it's really nice and thick and it's almost got this really nice Sheen and and Clarity to it which is just the butter and those natural thickening collagen juices from the beef stock one of the best ways that I use to serve this is uh is like a classic duck alange the juice of of two nice in seas and oranges if you imagine I've got all my soft vegetables in here I don't want to get too many impurity in my sauce so just tapping it by the side obviously the yield of your sauce would be a little bit affected so just one big push don't take it too far you could wash that again bring it to the boil and then put that back into the sauce and that's called what that's what they call it a remage so typically when you're making sauces in restaurants you would you would uh boil all of your socks for the second boil and there what you'd get is your sunde gravy or something like that orange at the end it should be thin so that it lines your mouth and if it's too thick what happens is it's almost like act as a barrier so you're uh your taste buds can't properly taste it so it's delicious does need a touch of salt just need a touch of vinegar just for a little bit of freshness at the end consistency of the sauce is nice nice and shiny cook it on the crown the much more delicate way of cooking the duck hose carve duck is","The transcript discusses the five mother sauces, foundational to French cuisine, created by Auguste Escoffier, and their variations. It begins with Bechamel, a milk-based sauce that is versatile for many dishes, followed by Velouté, a stock-based sauce with a velvety texture, which can be enhanced with mustard or herbs. Espagnole, a rich, meat-based sauce with vegetables and stock, is used as the base for various sauces like Bordelaise and Demi-Glace. The process of making these sauces, including the importance of temperature control, seasoning, and cooking techniques, is emphasized to achieve consistency, flavor depth, and smooth textures, essential for elevating dishes in a Michelin-star kitchen."
all right home cooks it's time for you to demonstrate another classic french technique are you primed to see what it is yes yes you look terrified just need to know what it is this time your survival depends on [Music] a butter basted steak perfectly cooked to medium rare the french term for this technique is arose we're looking for a beautifully browned crust a tender pink interior with just a hint of red this is what i'm looking for exactly you got it yes yes i make butter basic steak fairly often so i have a really good shot at making it up to the balcony after this round the first thing i do is get my pan searing hot one of the most important aspects of this dish is getting a beautiful sear on the steak i'm very happy that it's steak and not a french omelet again two minutes to bring the pan up to high heat eight minutes to cook and five minutes to let your steak relax and you'll be cooking a perfect medium rare i'm extremely focused just trying to get this done in a timely manner so i have more than enough time to rest my skin [Music] it's very important when you seize a meat to be liberal because a lot of that seasoning will be lost to the pan i have to amp this salt up and butter i do not want to let the judges down i'm secretly rooting for jonathan he's an amazing charismatic guy and has a good soul i really do want this but i'm also missing my family my mom taught me how to cook she was a single mother and raised my brother and i i want them to be proud of what i'm gonna put on the plate today all the seasoning's been wiped off of jonathan he's wiping all the

for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out,"In this cooking course, the host aims to simplify the cooking

next level so today my challenge is to make an amazing cheap not too expensive steak night dinner perfect for a great date nights with a friends or even family but first let me run you through the ingredients Now Steak uh this is a beautiful skirt steak it's one of the sort of butcher Cuts it's very delicious um doesn't look the most appetizing but once it's cooked it is incredible the secret here is to let it rest and cut on the bias basically a cut across um arom mats some fresh rosem some th a little bit of garlic for the pepper sauce the peppercorn sauce is shalots and garlic and then these little mouse Piper potatoes basically potatoes full of lots of starch I'm going to show you a little trick how to get them super thin we're going to blanch them twice at a low heat and then whack up the temperature and get them nice and crispy they're going to be called shoestring fries first off the steak okay it's really important to help this steak marinade so again I like to get the steak marinated with seasonings 10 15 minutes before I cook it salt pepper and then just roll that in and literally get the steak up the room temperature if you get the steak up the room temperature I I promise you it will cook so much more even the fat will soften therefore it will render quickly if a steak comes out the fridge and it's ice cold it's really impossible to get that cook spot on especially in the center now from there Touch of oil get that pan nicely smoking I like to get the garlic and literally just crush the garlic with the back of the knife lightly and that will allow all that oil to really perfume steak in layer away from you now I've got a really nice sort of beveled Edge on that pan use the pan and let the pan do the work tilt the pan and it Cooks the back of the steak and really keep that on a high heat if we don't get the color on there the actual skirt steak turns really gray so be vigorous with the color and show some confidence but let the pan do the work turn down the heat and let if your pan starts getting too hot add a touch more cold oil to cool the thing down now the potatoes these have been washed cleaned and peeled and this little Gadget here cost literally £250 it's the amazing peeler but not just any peeler it's a peeler that literally Cuts nice little string across and just get onto the corner of the potato and literally pull down and you can see what's starting to happen look got these nice beautiful shw string fries and the secret here is blanching them don't need to wash the potato I don't like washing off all the star just open them up get the peeler on the corner and just go down and around now they're called Sho string cuz they literally do look like a shoe string okay and again the secret here is making sure that we blanch these first and then back in to the oil the second time it's amazing how far one potato can literally go now that I got a little groove on there go back over turn my steak and look now I've got that color in there turn the gas right down and stick in my Thyme and Rose meat with that a little bit of butter now and all we're going to be doing is adding some some really nice texture and flavor to that lovely steak gas right down and just roll that skirt steak around all those arom mats as the butter caramelizes it turns into rece nut brown flavor the herbs start to perfume the steak and once I've colored the steak nicely I like to sip the herbs underneath and I like to just literally rest that steak on top of those herbs and literally turn the gas right down and just leave that steak sat there now back to the potatoes again nice thin shards this is a great way of sort of making I call them quick fries now look open them up beautiful don't season them at this point but just make sure they're all nicely separated so 150° or 350 F lift your basket up and then literally drop them in now this is called blanching okay and the secret here is to get a really nice crispy texture on those fries so we're not actually cooking them we're sort of getting them half cooked going take them out and then whack up the temperature and get them really nice and crispy now have a look at that steak that is absolutely beautiful herbs doing its job I'm so happy with that I don't want it literally medium I like this thing medium rare okay so plenty butter in there now now for the peppercorn sauce this is a really easy sauce to make get your pepper corns whole pepper corns sprinkle them onto the board nice and gently I like this s course quite hot Bas of the pan and then just literally crunch also I don't like it too fine so that peppery flavor comes out now shalot onions just as good but I don't want it too finely chopped otherwise it burns I want to really start TI toasting the flavor of those amazing pepper corns chalot nicely slice garlic now blanching basically is cooking without any color as you can see these Sho string fries are sort of half cooked now I'm going take them out let them rest turn up the heat again continue rolling that steak and just let it sit there and amongst all all that wonderful Flavor now peppercorn sauce a little touch of oil open up the flavor of those pepper corns and toasting these pepper corns now we really bring out that nice peppery flavor I love it so just lightly toast them in with the shots this sauce is so easy to do so straightforward and so delicious now I've toasted the pepper couple of little knobs of butter in there okay and now with my garlic I don't want to slice the garlic I'm going to literally just grate that garlic over the shots that basically purees the garlic really nicely done and look under you there got that lovely garlic and add that into those shots now T more oil once those shalots start to [Music] caramelize you can see now with that garlic it almost disappears but it does its job and this is where the sauce goes up to another level okay pepper corns are infus us and if I had to taste those shalots now they're really peppery but we toasted them so it's a really nice mellow toasting and that's why I want the shalots nice and thick or the onions nice and thick because I don't want to lose the texture of that nice sweet caramelized beautiful onion Flavor now for the exciting part little bit of Brandy M stand back turn up the gas and Flay here we go beautiful off go the eyebrows they'll touch in there for good measure M look at that steak just sitting in that beautiful flavored oil beautiful so good I love letting that steak cool down in the pan because it's got the residual heat but more importantly it sort of protects it now once that Brandy has evaporated got this really nice sweet caramelized peppery flavor and now just a couple of tablespoons of beef stock and what we're looking for is almost like a caramel color reduce that beautiful stock down shalot of caramelized got that really nice peppery flavor as it's starting coming down to a glaze we going to add a heavy cream literally half the amount of cream as we did stock and that will give a really nice rich consistency so think about it steak's resting got this beautiful aav sauce and now for the fries just break them up again whack up your heat and then back in and this time it's going to go quick now you're going to see the color on these fries beautiful and they're starting to look like Sho right correct the seasoning of the sauce now whilst you're M that's delicious tou as salt doesn't need any more pepper reduce that down I want a nice thick Rich consistency now look at these fries beautiful take them out I love put them in a bowl with a little bit of paper in there okay that absorbs any excess fat they're really crispy in lightly season them I've got a little touch of smoked paprika as well and then on top of that a really nice grating of age parmesan and that makes the fries cheesy spicy and really delicious good let them sit there until we're ready now I like to keep this presentation simple okay the steak we never slice that too many times otherwise the goodness goes on on the board and not on the plate sauce is coming down first off get your fries and literally lift them up into a nice big nest set them on the plate you can hear how crisp they are and they look like these beautiful fried Sho string and then literally look at that steak now you've got those beautiful lines we're going to slice on the bias and just take it off there check it's nice and medium rare check the seasoning M beautiful one 2 3 4 and five these bits sit on the bottom I lightly season that and then lift up your steak place that on top of those bases the steak has rested beautifully I'm going to give that a nice little season over and then just a gentle season because we've exposed the meat so it's seasoned on the outside but it's not seasoned the center I love the consistency of the pepper sauce nice and Rich a little knob of butter and just let that melt in that puts a really nice sheen on the sauce and the butter actually Mellows out the pepperiness of that toasted black pepper but look the color of the fries and now check the seasoning before we sauce and then finally get a nice spoon and go over and this is where the magic starts doesn't need too much sauce but I've got crushed peppers caramelized shots the garlic pureed and a delicious set of shoe string fries and that right there is is the most amazing skirt steak with a peppercorn sauce and delicious Sho string fries thank you so much for watching now please let me know in the comments what you

sauce, and crispy shoestring fries. He starts by marinating the steak with salt and pepper, allowing it to reach room temperature for even cooking. After searing the steak in a hot pan with garlic and herbs, he prepares the shoestring fries by blanching them twice before frying them until crispy. For the peppercorn sauce, he toasts whole peppercorns, caramelizes shallots and garlic, then adds brandy, beef stock, and cream to create a rich sauce. The dish is served with the steak sliced on the bias, topped with the peppercorn sauce, and paired with the crispy fries seasoned with smoked paprika and Parmesan."
my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cereso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and get your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to the bowl i'm gonna infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chilli's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that make sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated it tastes really fishy you've got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of

stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day whether it's breads cakes tarts pies or pastries bacon is one of the most seductive skills in the kitchen it fills the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catching needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with the oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission star establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive getting to grips with bacon is just a matter of confidence slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouthwateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so,"The chef demonstrates several recipes, starting with a stuffed roast chicken featuring chorizo, cannellini beans, tomatoes, and herbs, which keeps the chicken moist and flavorful. The bird is seasoned with lemon, olive oil, and paprika, roasted with white wine and water, and then served with its delicious stuffing and crispy skin. Next, he prepares miso-poached salmon with Asian vegetables, poaching the salmon in a fragrant broth made with miso paste, fish stock, kaffir lime, ginger, and chili, before serving it with broccoli, bok choy, and enoki mushrooms. He also makes focaccia bread, kneading a dough of bread flour, semolina, yeast, and olive oil, topped with tomatoes, rosemary, and salt, then baked until golden. Finally, the chef shows how to make slow-cooked beef short ribs, searing them first for rich flavor, then braising with tomato puree, red wine, garlic, and stock for tender, melt-in-your-mouth results."

bit of brisket first things first season it once you've seasoned them combine them together we're binding this together with a touch of egg that sticks it together and more importantly try and get this done the day before you get this done the day before set them in the fridge so they stay nice and firm that way they don't fall apart on the grill get that grill piping hot now this is one of my most desired burgers one of my favorite burgers this is for me called the f-word burger which is actually on sale at my burger restaurant at planet hollywood in vegas now season them let the meat relax a little bit don't take them out the fridge ice cold otherwise they'll be dry on the outside and raw in the middle grill piping hot a little touch of oil on the burger to start off with this is a beautiful grapeseed oil make sure it's seasoned also roll the seasoning round the edge of the burger you know you can't season the burger after it's cooked so make sure you roll that seasoning around the outside and mop up all that seasoning gently all the burgers and then on find the hottest spot which is normally two thirds of the way up once you put burger on the grill the secret is to move it as less as possible the more you move it the more chance you've got a break in the burger and then look on now from there lid down that incorporates the heat gets a great sear on the bottom so when we come to turn those burgers they don't stick how many times have you stuck burgers on a grill and wondered why it's sticking nicely oiled quick sear and put that lid down really important now alongside my burger i'm gonna be toasting the buns why do we toast the buns we toast the bun because there's nothing worse than the soggy bun how many times you had a burger and the bun is wet if you toast that bun it gets nice and crisp and it protects the burger so salt pepper a little drizzle of oil and lightly toast those buns back up lift quick in toast those buns what goes well with the burger great cheese tomato lettuce a little bit of mustard mayonnaise and then these beauties here grilled onions peel the onion slice them lightly season them salt pepper fresh grilled onions on a

bun top and bottom onions on lid back down now look at that bun beautiful turn these bow beauties over wow the flame is the flavor okay use a long spatula a busy grill is a delicious grill so you don't cook the burger and then set up for dressing you get set up first so while the burger's cooking you get everything done first it's a really important tip why it stops the burger going cold and also you want to eat it while it's piping hot mmm look at those babies caramelize those onions love those now at my burger restaurants in las vegas we baste the burgers with devonshire butter today we're just going to lightly brush a bit of butter onto the burgers with that flame underneath it sort of caramelizes the butter and puts this wonderful flavor on top so just lightly brush a little bit of butter on there and it makes the burger so tasty now you want to become even more chefy what can you do make it a red wine butter a chipotle butter this is the basic amazing recipe for a great burger it's up to you to sort of make it your own but lightly brushing the burgers with a touch of butter two minutes before they come off so exciting look at the color of those burgers notice how there's no shrinkage there because we've got the right amount of fat in there and with this butter it makes it so flavoursome right time to flip over again literally three and a half to four minutes each side look at that that is a burger to die for and then a light brush now before they come off the grill lightly season them on the grill look from a distance the first part of the seasoning is cooked and it's inside that burger last part of the seasoning literally before you take them off really important season season season season close now for the exciting part here's the base okay that's the bum of the burger base base base three tops three bases think about how you're gonna assemble this think about once it's clutched in your hand 30 seconds before those burgers come off and i put my nice beautiful rich cheddar cheese on top so on let's go there cheese on on on remember we season underneath that so the flavor inside is gonna be incredible first off a little touch of mayonnaise this is a light mustard mayonnaise on look at that on i'm gonna go for the top as well how many times have you seen guests that have opened up a burger they tried to put ketchup or mayonnaise once you've assembled the burger you can't re-break it down you've got to put it together and eat it nice and whole so you want this oozing out the side now mayonnaise on from there take your lettuce and just lightly snap the lettuce break that in half and sort of manipulate the lettuce where it sits literally on your bun snap it break it and form the lettuce the same shape of your bun snap it break it and gently push it down from there a nice slice of tomato after that give me an s s give me an a a give me an l l give me a t salt and pepper on that tomato lightly season it beautifully done and look from there a touch more mayonnaise a touch just a touch now here's where it goes up a level look at that cheese that come on seriously beautiful on she goes number two on she goes i mean number three on she goes how do we elevate it even more how do we take that to another level look at these on seriously i mean freshly grilled onions to absolutely die for take them off caramelize the onions and then the flavor from inside that is incredible on on being generous with those onions there i'm not a big fan of raw onion on a burger it's too harsh it's too acidic and it blows the flavor of that amazing pate and then look from there on down and hold that baby in on down and on on down and in and look watch what happens look at this slice slice slice slice slice down so if you can't manage your whole one take half of one and then look we go boom boom and boom that is why i have one of the busiest households anywhere in america where you've got a neighbour like

you can cook with him I love the smell of them she's been grown an incredible array of herbs in the wet Cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell obey from a basil at 50 paces we grow about a hundred and fifty varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after I out broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs and things like Parsi as a rocket coriander we grow two main types of paths we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavor-wise I think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavor this is your common basil sweet Genovese this is a purple variety called Reuben with a Greek basil Thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes of summer basil Lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that could never live without basil as Lorraine says it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet pungent flavor great Blitzen pesto's sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh used both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savory dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often using thai dishes kinder is perfect and curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of French cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct and the sea flavor great with chicken or enriched creamy sauces and finally chervil both modern sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick sauce those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones tends to be a more woody France things like thyme rosemary they've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like time but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well it's just gonna give you a slightly different flavor in your dish part herbs like thyme could take more intense cooking than soft herbs so the great in stews roasts or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five I use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets Lorraine's favorite time a heady aromatic pungent herb

sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamberry a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the

and my take on an iconic american salad first made almost a century ago caesar salad is definitely a classic but the trick to keeping dishes like this modern and relevant is to tweak them but not lose what made them brilliant in the first place here's my version for the ultimate american lunch my first twist is in the dressing for me the most important part of the caesar salad is that dressing rich creamy slightly spicy begin by making a basic mayonnaise start off with the egg yolks in just a little spoon dijon and then a little splash of red wine vinegar start whisking once you've got that nice slightly thickened texture drizzle in your,"The transcript covers the preparation of several dishes, starting with sticky spiced chicken wings marinated in tamarind paste, palm sugar, chili flakes, garlic, fish sauce, and oil, then cooked in the oven. For a side, a Thai green curry rice is made using homemade green curry paste, jasmine rice, and various herbs and spices. Green beans are blanched and tossed in a garlic and peanut dressing. The French dinner follows with a chicken fricassee, where chicken is browned and simmered with herbs, stock, and pancetta, paired with sautéed potatoes cooked in goose fat and finished with rosemary and thyme. A lavender creme caramel for dessert is prepared by making lavender sugar and a custard mixture, then baking in a water bath. Lastly, the transcript mentions peanut butter and jam cookies, followed by a twist on a classic Caesar salad with a rich, creamy dressing."
the secret to making great food is to ensure you lock in every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them from the out of my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavour and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or chorizo a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley sprinkling is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs in a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the bread crumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in we'll touch the salt and pepper your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's gonna give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning nice soft texture of the meatball for that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm gonna finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so i'll cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice i've got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft and the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch to dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm going to use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in cling film set that in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which give them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling at those absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time into the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'll do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the pancetta gets lovely and crispy finely sliced leeks and add oh leek some bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down exactly what i want those leaks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor's amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it it's really nice of richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt a touch of pepper and i grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix need one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero [Music] really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters so you've got all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful [Music] and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you can left that really nice intense flavor garlic nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken stock would reduce down by half and it's almost delays at the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just gonna turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish,"This transcript describes the preparation of three different dishes: spicy sausage rice, meatballs in coconut milk, and a quiche. For the rice, sausages are removed from their casings and cooked with onions, peppers, garlic, and spices, before being mixed with rice, wine, and stock to simmer. The meatball recipe involves creating a rich mix with minced beef, breadcrumbs, milk, and seasonings, then cooking the meatballs in a fragrant coconut milk broth, finished with lime zest. The quiche uses shortcrust pastry, filled with pancetta, leeks, cream, and cheese, then baked to a golden, crisp finish. Each dish emphasizes enhancing flavors through careful preparation and cooking techniques."
I had the three piece working for delivery and then what just came in oh sorry let me just pop this in the fryer and then I will chaotic situations frier is bubbling away we are very much open for business right now so uh we're going to make this happen but it's going to be great hi I'm Eric Wang I'm the chef and founder of pecking house in Brooklyn New York today we're going to make my perfect fried [Music] rice I've trained in New York as a chef for the last 12 years I was a cook at gr's Tavern and then most recently I was was a su chef at 11 Masson Park and then when the pandemic started my family's restaurant got locked down so I started frying chicken and thus it has become my life the reason fried rice tastes different in a restaurant than the kind you have at home it's usually thanks to these very intense walk burners that look like Rocket Fuel great seasoning emulsified rice every grain is going to be covered in a light slick of oil and then high heat that's the flavor we're trying to cultivate by using these really intense walks over here so this is going to be a chicken fried rice just like the one that my mom makes in her restaurant the one I grew up in and the first step is to marinate the chicken with a Technique we call velveting velveting is a technique to prepare proteins for stir fries it really improves their texture keeps them really moist and gives them a nice bouncy texture so egg whites obviously have protein and they are slightly alkaline and that alkaline texture is actually going to tenderize the protein a little bit and that's what gives those stir fry ingredients you get in your Chinese takeout that unique texture okay um CH sandwich swi P that sandwich chilio okay so we're going to cut this into very thin strips this is chicken breast boneless skinless you can use chicken thigh you can use whatever you want we're aiming for kind of like needly consistency not quite spaghetti but maybe a little thicker than that what should we say butini so normally in a Chinese restaurant at least how we would do it at my mom's place we would freeze these slice them on a deli slicer and then cut them into strips it's a little harder to do with fresh chicken why is Chinese cuisine such thin portions of me whereas like a lot of Western cooking is these giant roast and such like that I learned recently is because China is considered quite poor in fuel as in like wood and uh combustible fuel so they generally prepare things to be cooked as quickly as possible whereas there were a great deal of forest in Europe and that's why you can create these big fires and big bread and such and such my mom would probably tell me to cut these thinner but you know this is what we're doing here it'll cook very quickly so we have our chicken strips We're going to add a little salt some cornstarch corn starch is going to allow the protein to hold on to a little bit of moisture by hydrating and then we're going to add a little baking soda again alkalinity is going to tenderize proteins a little bit this is going to give it the texture of that great Chinese American dish chicken and broccoli that really nice slippery and bouncy texture of a thinly sliced piece of chicken that is not a achievable unless you do this step okay so we have our chicken velvety we're going to put this away for a second and then we're going to address the [Music] rice so D rice is the key to fried rice it's the history you know using leftover rice how would you bring it back to life and make it something delicious it is crystalized the starches in it have made it hard but it makes it great for stir fry cuz it's going to be really loose and fluffy it's going to hold on the fat for a little bit and that's what gives grap fried rice this awesome texture so this would be rice that is drying out overnight we got racks and racks and racks of it and as you see after we fluff it we pack in these containers and then we get ready to Fred rice during service at home since you're doing a small quantity I wouldn't worry about it too much if you got it that white takeout carton you just didn't finish your rice from your takeout meal the night before it'll be totally fine ready to fry the next day we use jasmine rice in the restaurant all varieties of rice contain a measure of amope pcin it's Ultra exaggerated in risoto rice that makes it really sticky and creamy and then there's less of it in long grain rice which is why it's nice and drier and fluffy and like in individual grains this is very much a really important step fluffing the rice cooking your rice the day before at least then taking the time the next day to run through it massage it all into these beautiful little fluffy grains so if you're making fried rice at home and you see that it has become a congealed clumpy Mass unappetizing it is because you have skipped this step and your ancestors would be disappointed yeah you run out of rice what do you do oh man you're screwed dude you're fo my mom's going to yell at you you can use fresh rice what you could do is you could use slightly less water when you're cooking your rice that will prevent it from being super sticky so you would get something that's a little closer to the ideal texture of fried rice so our rice is fluffed lovingly going to put this in a separate container if I was really slick I would do the parchment slide but I don't trust myself on camera let's see please hold yeah so we're going to prep the rest of our ingredients it's really important when making fried rice any sort of stir fry uh that everything is as close to ready as possible most things that cook and walk they only take about 45 seconds to a minute it happens really fast so it's really important that you have everything ready you're well prepared and then you're off to the raises all right we're going to make our eggs we're going to scramble them up and it's a very inexpensive and easy way to add protein to the dish it just has a wonderful texture to it obviously they're not going to be creamy scrambled they're going to be kind of firmly set but it eats really well with all the fluffy rice that we're going to make I said fluffy how many times today so we're going to beat them all out whisk them nicely and get them ready for our fried rice some would say I should use chopsticks believe it or not I don't have Chopsticks in this restaurant great dishonor and shame we're going to dice some onion up when you're stir frying vegetables even for fried rice you don't want them to be too soft we want to texture that it still has a little bit of bite it's not too mushy so can't be too small can Lopez calls it Tender Crisp I think that's a great term I don't add garlic to fried rice I think it's a little much everyone thinks like anytime you cook something Chinese it has to have garlic ginger and scallions in it that's not true then we're going to do our scallions going to separate them into the dark green and then the light green and the whites are going to go together we're going to cook these first they're a little bit more pungent but they're going to add a really nice foundation and savoriness to it and then we're just going to finish with the dark green part so as color has pungency has Aroma my mom has a Chinese restaurant on Long Island her original restaurant was in Queen it was called peeking house her and my father were servers there the owner sold it to my parents I grew up taking phone calls takeout orders reservations busting tables learned a lot about life also going in this thing we got peas and carrots very classic for Chinese takeout restaurants and adds a really nice bit of color and texture we're going to add soy sauce to our fried rice to add salinity to add Umami savoriness you're going to add the soy sauce around the edge just so it Cooks down a little bit reduces just very slightly you don't want it to be too wet but you do also want to add all that color Aroma and salinity there's a very specific technique when you're stir frying things you're adding your seasonings your liquid seasonings along the edge of the pan the only other seasonings besides soy sauce salt and MSG you can't have grap fried rice without some degree of MSG it is simply a salt it is glutamates it's what activates in your tongue and your brain to develop that flavor of savoriness what Japanese people call Umami and you should have in your home it's very useful so we like to add a little butter to our fried rice not traditional but rice and butter are great friends it works really well you just need a little bit kind of brings the whole party together ties the room together if you will okay we got everything ready to go here again this is come together really quickly and we're going to make some fried rice all right we got our chicken velveted here I'm going to do a pass through and the idea here is to set the texture cook the chicken through obviously before we stirfry everything so we have everything ready beforehand then the rice comes together very quickly it's called the pasture just because you're cooking it very quickly usually you just pass it through hot oil because you have this like almost paper thin slice of protein it Cooks in like 30 seconds we can also do it in water it just changes the fat content of where you're trying to cook if you're stir frying something you might want that oil but since fried rice we're going to add oil and we can just use water unlike in Western cooking you're not trying to get a fond by searing chicken in a walk or a pan or anything like that you just want everything cooked ahead of time you get all the color and the flavor from the soy sauce and the other seasonings if you didn't velvet your chicken you don't need to do a past through you could cook it in the pan beforehand that's totally fine we are cooking this in a walk as it would be done in a Chinese restaurant a very thin sheet of either cast iron or carbon steel and uh it doesn't retain heat very long because it's very thin but it does transfer very quickly which is why we have these massive jet burners we're looking for something called wak ha it's uh the Cantonese term literally translates to breath of the walk it's that really intense heat that almost Char flavor that you have to a lot of great Chinese cuisine that's difficult to replicate at homes it's from the intense heat that's combusting the fats in your fried rice and your stir fries all oils have a smoke point point and you can achieve that very quickly by tossing food through the fire of a walk burner it's lightly smoky it's lightly charred and it's it tastes like intense heat if you believe it or not if you have a gas burner you can be tossing your food through the gas burner as we'll see in the stir fry technique but if failing that you could also use a blowtorch all right we have a two ring cantones burner here for this big walk here we need this walk super hot we want the oil to be smoking the second it hits the pen as you can see it's already starting to smoke going on onions little bit of eggs you want to add the eggs first so that they set you don't want to add them on top of the rice cuz then it emulsifies with the rice it's an entirely different product everything happens really quickly we set the eggs first and then everything comes together all right we're going on Rice we're rocking it against the the sides so that we're cradling it against the flame as much as we can enough oil so that the fried rice has a bit of a shine we're tossing it over the flame over the gas [Music] burner a noisy Affair all right then we're going to go in with our other seasonings park it for one second going to do some peas and carrots scallions salt and a little bit of MSG fire it up again you always want it to be in motion otherwise it's going to burn a little bit that's not what you want you want charred flavor but you don't want to burn your ingredients soy sauce again we're adding it around the side of the pan so caramelizes immediately you want it to reduce just ever so slightly as you're making it just as we're almost finishing I'm just going to add the smallest bit of butter it's going to give it a little shine just my personal touch you can kind of learn by experience with the texture and how it falls the grains are no longer hard they're not bouncing around the walk they're almost moving with it in a wave motion that's kind of how you know that it's ready all right this is how you want to be eating your fried rice when it's hot steaming almost going to burn your mouth nice individual grains no clumps everything's kind of the same size if you eat it with one bite that's good oh hot has that um really lovely texture individual grains light but still has like a light slick of oil to everything peas are nice onions still have a little texture chicken is really silky and bouncy at the same time to me it has just the right amount of salt and MSG it does have that kind of like lightly Smoky Aroma that's really important otherwise fried,"Eric Wang, chef and founder of Pecking House in Brooklyn, demonstrates how to make his perfect fried rice. He begins by marinating chicken using a velveting technique to improve texture and tenderness, then prepares jasmine rice, which is essential for achieving the right texture in fried rice. After preparing ingredients like eggs, onions, and peas, he stir-fries everything in a wok heated to a high temperature, ensuring quick cooking to maintain flavor and texture. The key steps involve cooking the rice the day before, keeping ingredients prepared, using soy sauce and MSG for seasoning, and finishing with a touch of butter for added richness. The result is a flavorful, smoky, and texturally balanced fried rice."
"Hi guys, I am Luciano Monosilio The chef and owner of Luciano Cucina Italiana The restaurant in the centre of Rome Our restaurant is very famous for one dish The Carbonara Today I am going to show you how to make my home recipe We have very simple ingredients And then we are going to mix all these ingredients together We will start first from the Guanciale After black pepper Then eggs Parmesan cheese and Pecorino cheese We blend, we mix the cheese It's very important to clean the Guanciale We remove all the black pepper on top and also the skin at the back And then, when the Guanciale is clean We start to cut the Guanciale We make small cubes This has to be the size of Guanciale It is very important because We are going to cook the Guanciale with its fat We don't use olive oil, butter, anything Just Guanciale That's it With the Guanciale already cut We go on the fire If we have gas, we use the iron pan If you don't have gas and use induction, you can use an non-stick pan That is very important for cooking properly the Guanciale The we start with the fire. First we put the fire very high So we warm up the pan When the pan is warm... We put the fire on low We are going in with the Guanciale We can hear it starts frying very low heat When the Guanciale is cooking, we going to make the sauce with the eggs Now we start to make the egg sauce for the Carbonara In my recipe I use only the yolks, the red part of the eggs I use one egg per person If the eggs are small, I use three, one and a half per person Like in this case You see now, the Guanciale starts frying in the pan Grana Padano (Parmesan) And Pecorino When you make the cheese, I suggest to mix Pecorino and Grana Padano (Parmesan) Because the Pecorino sometimes is very salty I suggest to mix to balance the flavor with the Grana Padano So it is less salty That's why we use 2 parts of Pecorino and 1 part of Grana Padano To make Carbonara we use this kind of pan It's called 'Bagno Maria' Later I will show you why we use this type of pan. Cheese Eggs And black pepper See the Guanciale It's crispy outside And should be very soft inside With this fat we make the sauce We put half of this one in the egg sauce And the we remove completely the fat An then we can save the Guanciale And now we mix the sauce We put some pasta water To make our Carbonara we use Spaghetti It's very important that the boiling water is salted but not too much So we put very little salt When the water is boiling We put the Spaghetti And now we have to wait - 12 minutes So guys, we are almost ready We have three minutes left and then we will check the pasta It's very important that the pasta is cooked properly Especially for this recipe we don't do the pasta 'al dente' Because we need the pasta to be cooked properly. It has to be soft because after I show you how to make the Carbonara with the 'Bagno Maria' We check We are ready Some boiling water And now we will wait We cook the pasta in the 'Bagno Maria' because we have the very right temperature like that we cook the eggs very gently we have to have a temperature of 65 degrees centigrade with this technique the eggs with the cheese should be very creamy And then, now we put the Guanciale inside. It's very important the Guanciale has to be hot. Now it is room temperature Some more black pepper And then we prepare the plate We have decided to make this plate for the Carbonara It's a special plate It's not a normal plate, because on the back you have the recipe of the Carbonara The eggs start to be very creamy Now it is ready Now And then we finish the Carbonara with Guanciale on top Some cream And then we finish with the Pecorino cheese on top And black pepper Pecorino cheese And black pepper And that's it: our Carbonara is ready This place is the house of Carbonara Our recipe is very special, because we have decided to make the Carbonara in a different way We try to find a very good balance from the Guanciale and the pasta And also we make very good... flavor of cheese The new generation doesn't like the Pecorino cheese because it is too salty. Actually sometimes it's spicy So we have decided to balance it with the Grana (Parmesan) because first for the flavors to make it more light and after, because Grana is a very creamy cheese the Grana helps us to how to make this cream of our Carbonara You can see it looks like with cream inside but there is no cream inside I hope you are going to enjoy For everything, you just call me up","Luciano Monosilio, chef and owner of Luciano Cucina Italiana in Rome, demonstrates his recipe for Carbonara, which uses simple ingredients: Guanciale, eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino cheese, and black pepper. He begins by cleaning and chopping the Guanciale, then frying it in its own fat over low heat. The egg mixture is made with egg yolks, Pecorino, and Grana Padano cheese, balancing the saltiness of the Pecorino with the creaminess of the Parmesan. The pasta is cooked in salted water and mixed with the egg sauce and Guanciale. The 'Bagno Maria' technique ensures the eggs cook gently, creating a creamy texture without cream. Finally, the dish is finished with more Pecorino, black pepper, and Guanciale on top."
some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier [Music] this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken [Music] with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first [Music] salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked [Music] make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there [Music] now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavour on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] so smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated piles and cheese give your veg some attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild

states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate [Music] the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh

top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] you,"The recipe begins with soaking rice noodles in hot water for 12-15 minutes. Chicken is sliced thinly and flattened using a rolling pin for faster cooking, while garlic and broccoli are prepared. The chicken is cooked in a hot pan with garlic, followed by the broccoli and soy sauce. Afterward, eggs are whisked and added to the pan with the noodles, chicken, and broccoli to form a stir-fry. For gnocchi, leftover baked potatoes are mashed with ricotta, flour, eggs, and thyme, then rolled into small pieces and boiled until they float. After boiling, they are sautéed until golden and served with peas and lemon zest. Finally, a simple New York-style cheesecake is made by mixing cream cheese, sugar, eggs, flour, lemon zest, and raspberries, baked until golden and souffléed."

little dr. Steve ruffle doesn't know I think I am obsessed with South I'm obsessed primarily with watercress that's in my heart Castillo got a PhD of watercress a doctorate in salad we should all take a leaf out his book then he's not only been studying sudden leaves for over 30 years he's been growing them so he really knows he's rocket from his romaine there are literally thousands of varieties of salad things like the Tavian lettuce red veined spinach wild rocket sorrel we grow virtually everything outdoors and and we follow the seasons so we're not forcing the leaves we don't give them too much fertilizer or irrigation we try to grow them a little bit slower and that's the way to get the best flavor and the best quality of leaf will harvest a crop cut it in the morning it's then on the road going out to customers to be on the Shelf the next day this is a great leaf baby leaf spinach and we call it baby leaf yeah quite literally because we cut it when it's still at a baby stage these are baby pea shoots we'll put something like three or four hundred pea seeds into the seed bed and then in as little as 12 14 days they've grown to a sort of a crop like this they've got the flavor of fresh peas a bit of sweetness and they and they got a really nice soft velvety leaf texture this is baby watercress which is my favorite salad crop of them all watercress is special because by definition it's grown in pure flowing water fresh watercress has got that fantastic pungent peppery flavor in Victorian London it was known as poor man's bread whereby a lot of workers would start the day with a watercress sandwich and if they couldn't afford bread they just ate the watercress straight it is an amazing full of flavor I can't eat enough sell it obsessed thieves spot on there's hundreds of salad leaves available with different textures tastes and colors here are five my favorite everyday salad leaves and don't forget some of them are delicious cooked - little gem sweet and crisp and an amazingly dense heart these many cause lettuces are great simply braised in the oven or use the leaves as scoops for delicious chili beef filling mustard leaves pungent spicy and full of vitamin C these are a staple in Asian dishes and are fantastic stir fried or steamed lambs leaf full of tangy flavor and with incredible springy stems great for hearty robust salads or simply paired with fish for a healthier simple supper rocket these distinctive peppery leaves are actually classed as a herb and are perfect in soups or with fruits and are full of iron finally chicory or on leave these tightly packed red or white leaves have a deliciously bitter taste and are great wrapped in ham or alongside shine blue cheeses I think when you're shopping for salads you can just shop with your eyes you know if it looks fresh and healthy tasty it is you want to look for bright colors I like to see leaves with a bit of moisture on them sounds like to be kept cold and moist basically so when you buy a packaged salad put it in the fridge and if you don't use it all in one go roll up the bag to exclude surplus air put it back in the fridge keep it cold there's so much choice of writing out there I really do think people should be more adventurous in their choice of salads here both what they choose to try and eat and and what they do with them so get yourself some ingredients use them boldly and your studded leaves can really take center stage next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips dorbz are a fantastic ingredient when you want a special salad that really impresses here's how to prepare them do not be intimidated trying to get the scallop out i'ma show you how easy it is to take them out and how much more exciting is to get them fresh in the shell so just face it the dessert spoon and a blunt knife put the knife in to the bottom and you just twist open till the knife up set doesn't cut into the scallop meat run the knife on the top to the base off with a lid no flesh on there and then from there that's cool just scallops skirt all you do is just peel that forward and get the spoon to run down the back of the shell and the idea is to remove that little bit of muscle that holds the scallop on to the bottom shelf bang it pops out that's the top the small side of the bottom there's the muscle there and your thumb just slides neatly in there and run your fingers round and you just pop out Scott up and look bang beautiful this bit here is called the skirt no use doesn't taste everything now that's the coral you can slice that off dry it in the oven and use it as a powder for your risottos or even seasoning fish with but that's their money these just need to be rinsed under cold water dried and ready for the pan tomatoes are another salad staple his how to skin them for extra refinement score each one with a cross at the bottom blanch in boiling water for a minute then shot them in cold water and the skins will easily peel away pomegranates are a fabulous fruit by adding glamour to salads or desserts the trick to getting the seeds out slice in half lengthways makes its around the edge turn upside down over a bowl and using a large spoon whack as hard as you can to release the seeds to take fabulous fruit puts the next level my tip is to add sophisticated cornell's of ice cream or lemon mascarpone simply dip two metal spoons in hot water scoop shape and add and after baking never throw out your leftover pastry it's easy transformed into grapefruit or savory party nibbles roll out break Parmesan or sprinkle over your favorite fruit roll and then just slice and bake [Music] as any chef knows at the end of a meal you want to leave your guests on a high with a spectacular dessert so when you're cooking for a special occasion and want to make an impact it's great to have a fabulous fruit dessert up your sleeve [Music] my last recipe looks sensational and tastes just as good raspberry milfoil desserts should always have that wow factor and this dish is incredibly simple to prepare but it tastes and looks absolutely stunning first off puff pastry you can buy fabulous puff pastry now a non-stick baking tray and just lay the puff pastry on the tray I want to get the top of the puff pastry camera eyes so we're going to dust it in icing sugar now move 40 means a thousand layers just lightly dust the top of the puff pastry with icing sugar we're gonna start off in a hot oven at 220 for the first six or seven minutes and then ten minutes at 190 into the oven now for the filling fresh vanilla cream in you start whisking what the cream whisk nice and thick but look at all that nice fresh vanilla seeds in there next a nice scraping of orange zest all right look cure don't whisk that in,"The transcript covers the preparation of several vibrant and flavorful salads perfect for special occasions.

The team, consisting of prisoners trained in cooking, is under strict supervision as they finalize dishes, ensuring everything is perfect for the minister's visit. The success of the project depends on impressing Clark, who is considering continued government support for the initiative, which aims to provide prisoners with skills for life after release. Despite the challenges, the team is hopeful, with the bakery already supplying products to Cafe Nero. The minister expresses interest but stresses the importance of a solid business plan and financial sustainability before making a commitment."

WE BELIEVE COMING WAS","An American Airlines passenger flight collided mid-air with an Army Blackhawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., over the Potomac River. The crash, which occurred shortly before 9 p.m. near Reagan National Airport, resulted in the plane departing from Wichita, Kansas, with 60 passengers and four crew members, while the Blackhawk was believed to be on a training flight with three personnel. Search and rescue efforts are ongoing, with at least 12 bodies recovered. First responders face challenging conditions, including cold temperatures and ice. The incident also involved U.S. figure skating athletes, coaches, and family members returning from a camp."
an American Airlines flight has collided midair with a helicopter a military helicopter in Washington DC the US Federal Aviation Administration said it happened whilst on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 900 p.m. local time the jet we understand was carrying 60 passengers and four crew whilst three US Army soldiers were on board the Black Hawk military helicopter president Donald Trump says that he's been briefed on what he has described as the terrible accident and went on to thank emergency responders for their incredible work police divers and boats have been searching the water now for a number of hours looking for survivors whilst the US Federal authorities have begun their investigation okay let's cross to our correspondent Live From The Scene maril Thomas Marilyn you're there Merlin you're there first off um just take us through the timeline of what happened so what we know is that a commercial airline the American Airlines collided midair with an army Blackhawk helicopter and as you said there were 60 passengers on board the commercial airline as well as four crew members and there were also three soldiers on board the helicopter as well and just in the last few minutes as well we've seen reports that at least 18 bodies were recovered uh from the river that's according to our official Partners CBS but just to say there are there is no official update on the number of casualties as of yet and this is still a developing story but that Collision occurred here uh at around 9900 p.m. local time uh and it happened midair and it um it happened as the commercial airline was on its approach to Runway 33 and the scene that you can see behind me is the airport itself so you can see the the blue and red Sirens behind me and the Blackness to my left and that is the river as you can see here and there is a flurry of activity as the emergency operation is underway we know that there are uh emergency divers and police boats and emergency rescue operations very much underway but just to remind you it's midnight here local time and so it's extremely cold and it's dark and that will make that uh rescue operation all that much harder uh and you know we're constantly seeing more and more official um police cars and emergency responders arriving at this airport uh and we are expecting to hear a press conference in about half an hour and we'll expect more updates regularly throughout the night as well okay Merlin let's just uh go back to the the crash itself um I understand that there has been some audio that's been released um from Air Traffic Control um we are waiting for for more information on that but what have eyewitnesses described in the minutes leading up to that crash we've spoken to people here at the scene um and they didn't want to be named but one did tell me that they actually witnessed the moment of the Collision itself so they saw the fireball uh of the Collision itself and it was a bright orange in the sky and then it fell uh down into what this person uh thought was the river and he heard a loud uh boom sound as the Collision happened um and he described to me how scared and terrified he was um that he wanted to fall to his knees just watching um the moment happen before him couldn't quite believe his eyes um and so there's very much a lot of confusion here and people have been arriving at the airport um trying to find out what's happening um some people who have arrived expecting their their loved ones to arrive on other flights which have now been um re rooted to other airports all flights have been ground um to a halt here there are no flights taking off or Landing here um at all in the next few hours at least um that we know of um but we'll expect to hear more updates as we go through the night um more regularly okay so let me just reiterate what Merlin has told us there is a ground stop it's referred to as a ground stop this is a traffic management initiative which means that aircraft that meet specific criteria criteria need to remain on their on the ground at their origin origination Airport so there is a ground stop in place at Reagan National Airport no flights coming in no flights coming out Merlin there are two helicopters that are operating in the area and this is part of the search and uh rescue that is taking place at the moment what exactly are those helicopters doing what can you see them doing they have I'm I presume very bright spotlights on board what have you seen [Music] yeah I can hear them weing above me now you can hear that sound um and they are just monitoring the situation and we know that there are lots and lots of emergency responders on site dozens of fire trucks and and police um attending to the scene as well as U divers which have been sent from uh neighboring states like Maryland as well uh which H which are part of the rescue operation and we also know that the US Coast Guard is also involved in this operation as well and this will be a massive operation um and it will will be made all the more difficult by the fact that it is extremely cold here the temperature is cold even in the air and so it'll be even um colder in the water as well where this rescue operation is ongoing as we speak yeah I mean it it's it's only a matter of it's what a week just over a week that we had the inauguration of Donald Trump and because of that truly frigid weather it was moved indoors what are the conditions like along the river itself at the moment was it was it frozen over the pomac river Upstream it is it is frozen in Parts here it's hard to see because it's so dark it's it's just past midnight it's very dark here um and as I say it is very cold and so those rescue divers and this police will be operating in very frigid cold conditions and as you said uh you know we've had a spell of that here in DC and that is exactly what um prompted the inauguration to be moved indoors and so you know the city is just recovering from that and so there will be some of the river will still be frozen over we've seen elsewhere some of the tidal Bas in other bodies of water in the city here are still frozen over and you know just it was just a few days ago that there was still snow and ice um on these streets as well so the temperatures are very cold and the conditions are very difficult,"An American Airlines flight collided midair with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., while the flight was approaching Reagan Washington National Airport at 9:00 p.m. local time. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, while the helicopter had three soldiers on board. Emergency responders, including divers and boats, have been searching the water for survivors, and reports indicate at least 18 bodies have been recovered. The incident occurred in cold and dark conditions, complicating the rescue efforts. The airport is under a ground stop, halting all flights, and authorities have launched an investigation into the crash."
"and to the United States where an investigation has been launched after a passenger jet collided with a US military helicopter while Landing in Washington DC Rescuers have begun to search the river pomac uh nearby for survivors 67 people were on board the two aircraft at the time of the crash rescue boats searching the freezing pomac River for survivors both aircraft plunged into the icy waterway that cuts through Washington DC after to colliding in midair this footage from an EarthCam TV live stream captures the moment when the passenger plane and military helicopter hit and fell out of the sky the American Airlines flight from Kansas was on its way to land at Ronald Reagan National Airport when the crash occurred the US Army said that its helicopter was on a training Mission at the time divers are scouring the river for survival ders 64 people were on the plane and three on the helicopter but officials said the conditions were extremely difficult the water that we're operating in is about 8 ft deep um there is wind there is pieces of ice out there so it it's just dangerous and hard to work in and because there's not a lot of lights you're out there searching every square inch of space to see if you can find anybody the divers are doing the same thing in the water the water is dark it is murky um and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in investigations into how the Collision happened in some of the most heavily monitored airspace in the world just a few kilometers from the US capital are underway you president Trump has already taken to social media to criticize air traffic control for the crash saying that it should have been prevented let's pick up uh some of those points with uh journalist Matthew kuchi who joins us from Washington DC welcome Matthew let's start with that that that point about this being a a a busy uh airport um a a military helicopter and a civilian passenger jet which just absolutely a collision like this should not happen yeah most definitely you know this airspace is among the most busy and crowded in the world but also the most heavily regulated Reagan National Airport has about 25 million passengers fly through every single year but notice it's not a very big airport only three runways at any given point two are in use at the same time for the most part and yet they constantly churn through considerable volume most other major airports in the US might have three four or five runways so they do a lot with a little space factor in the fact that it's only 3 kilometers south of downtown DC with the White House the capital the Washington Monument just right over there lots of executive flights the president flying in and out lots of military exercises to it's a lot to keep track of and for years folks have said maybe the airspace is a little bit too busy maybe too many moving Parts it appears that may have been a factor tonight um what is being said about potential causes well just to give folks a bit of a bearing the pic river runs north to south the main Runway at Reagan National is 7,000 ft long it also runs north to south that's Runway one that usually Services the 3X3 three seat by3 seat bigger planes however smaller Regional Jet that are two seat by two seat sometimes use the shorter runways because they can there is a shorter Runway number 33 that goes Southeast to Northwest on nights like tonight when the wind is blowing out of the Northwest Pilots like to land that direction because it's better with lift as they start to land now for that to occur the planes have to sort of loop on the east side of the pomac and then turn to the left at the last minute that's what the plane did tonight it was cleared to land on Runway 33 however per Air Traffic Control there was that military helicopter that was told to essentially wait let the plane go by then follow behind the military helicopter acknowledged that it saw the plane but the fact that the Collision occurred indicates that perhaps the military aircraft was looking at the wrong plane or there was some sort of lapse of judgment this happened at night in the middle of winter and the Jet fell into a a river which sounds like a serious challenge for Rescuers most definitely you know the biggest fact factor that we ask all the time is to what extent did weather contribute to an accident like this you know meteorology and Aviation often times intersect as you all know I'm your meteorologist but you know I have to say tonight the weather at least for Aviation was great visibility was phenomenal the winds were relatively light so it doesn't seem like for the actual crash itself that was a factor at all however now for the search and rescue and potentially recovery Mission it's a huge obstacle temperatures right now are down around 4 30° fhe probably 4 or 5 degre C if that water temperatures are 35.8 de F or roughly two degrees Celsius so hypothermia would set in in minutes at the same time there's ice that is actually propagating along the pomac and so the fact that this accident occurred roughly 8ish hours ago would to me say that at this point we're likely not really looking at a rescue mission this is now a recovery Mission and so far there have been no confirmed reports of survivors it's difficult to not lose optimism and how will the investigation into this crash be handled well in the United States we have something called the NTSB the national Transportation safety Bureau that is tasked with reviewing all the data all the Angles and trying to figure out what potential causes there were contributing to this accident they're already on scene they are sort of serendipitously located in DC and so they're basically already here they'll be working in tanem with the FAA to interview both air traffic control and potentially eyewitnesses to coming through footage and then of course the black boxes the cockpit voice recorders uh the the data on board the plane but really uh I have sort of a sneaking suspicion that this investigation will sort of be a quicker one compared to other ones simply because we know the the passenger plane was cleared to land it was doing what it was supposed to do this looks like on every count an incursion or sort of a a trip to where it wasn't supposed to be of this helicopter a sort of you know not following instructions or deviating from where it should have gone okay thank you for talking us through that so clearly Matthew journalist Matthew kuchi in Washington DC thank you","An investigation is underway after an American Airlines passenger jet collided midair with a U.S. military Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., causing both aircraft to crash into the icy Potomac River. The American Airlines flight had 64 passengers on board, and the military helicopter carried three soldiers. Rescue operations have been hampered by freezing temperatures, murky water, and ice, making the search for survivors difficult. President Trump criticized air traffic control, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating potential causes, including whether the military helicopter deviated from its instructions. Weather conditions were not a factor in the crash, but the cold and hazardous environment have complicated rescue efforts."

firstly we've got an aircraft that that that is involved in an explosion a midair Collision there was an explosion a fireball at 350 ft above the water so it plummets down then it sinks into freezing coold water the chances of survival from that are a remote I would say and indications are at this very minute is that there are few if any survivors from this terrible tragedy my analysis is that the crj700 the American Airlines flight was complying with air traffic control directions to land at Reagan National Airport on the pic River the Blackhawk helicopter US Army um had taken off in close proximity and it had made six course changes as it climbed in altitude before it impacted the crj at about 350 ft um off the pomac river what that tells me is that it this was a training Flight of the helicopter uh it apparently did not have its adsb tracking uh system turned on this is is the signal that's sent out to air traffic control to track aircraft and it also is a vital component of another system called tcast which is traffic collision avoidance system fitted to all commercial aircraft and and military aircraft which alerts them to other aircraft on a collision course but the adsb must be turned on it's quite possible that this training flight of this Blackhawk helicopter was a a covert style training mission of going black if you like not having any electronic tracking turned on and tragic tragic eror um of doing this around you around an airport an active airport I mean if they're going to do that sort of training it should be done well away from an active airport like like Reagan national uh I would expect that they will have the black boxes recovered within 24 hours if not earlier they will have them read and analyzed I believe that we'll get a lot of detail uh within the next uh s to 14 days about what happened,"A midair collision occurred between an American Airlines CRJ700 and a US Army Blackhawk helicopter near Reagan National Airport, resulting in an explosion and both aircraft plummeting into the cold waters of the Potomac River. Survival chances are low, with few, if any, survivors. The helicopter, on a training flight, made six course changes before the crash, and it is suspected that its ADS-B tracking system was off, preventing the plane's collision avoidance system from detecting it. The analysis suggests the helicopter was operating covertly, which should not have been done near an active airport. Black boxes are expected to be recovered and analyzed within 24 hours for more details on the tragedy."

The incident, which occurred around 9 p.m. Eastern time, has triggered a massive search and rescue operation. Early reports suggest three people were aboard the Blackhawk, and emergency responders are working under difficult conditions, with water temperatures around 35 degrees. President Trump and local officials have been briefed, and divers are being deployed. Questions are arising about air traffic control, the coordination of the two aircraft, and whether collision avoidance systems were functioning."

BUT AS I MENTIONED, THERE WERE 64 PEOPLE, PASSENGERS AND CREW ON THE AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT OUT OF WICHITA AND THERE WERE AS WELL PEOPLE ON BOARD THAT MILITARY HELICOPTER. BUT AS FOR THE PASSENGERS ON THAT COMMERCIAL AIRLINE, CAROLINE BARGHOUT IS WITH US, AND SHE'S IN OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU. SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT WHO WAS ON THAT PLANE AND MUCH OF THE ATTENTION SO FAR THIS MORNING, CAROLINE, IS FOCUSING ON THE U.S. NATIONAL FIGURE SKATING PROGRAM. THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN QUITE A NUMBER OF FIGURE SKATERS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ON THAT PLANE. WHAT DO WE KNOW? >> THAT'S RIGHT, HEATHER. U.S. FIGURE SKATING SAYS THERE WERE SEVERAL SKATERS ON THAT PLANE. THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK FROM A NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAMP WHICH WAS IN WICHITA, KANSAS. IT ALSO COINCIDED WITH THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS WHICH WERE ALSO HELD IN KANSAS, AS YOU MENTIONED, THEIR COACHES AND FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ALSO ON THAT PLANE. NOW, THE GOVERNING BODY ISSUED A STATEMENT TODAY. IT SAID WE ARE DEVASTATED BY THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY AND HOLD THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES CLOSELY IN OUR HEARTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND WE WILL RELEASE MORE INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. WICHITA CITY COUNCILLOR, JD JOHNSON SAYS THIS TRAGEDY WILL AFFECT MANY PEOPLE IN THAT COMMUNITY. TAKE A LISTEN. >> MOST PEOPLE IN THE CITY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO KNOW SOMEBODY ON THAT FLIGHT, A FAMILY MEMBER, SOMEBODY, A COWORKER, SOMEBODY THAT'S ON THAT FLIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY TOUGH TIME FOR WICHITA, FOR THE FAMILIES IN WICHITA, AND IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. >> Reporter: THE KREMLIN SAYS THERE WERE ALSO RUSSIAN CITIZENS ON THAT PLANE, ICE SKATING COACHES AND FORMER WORLD CHAMPIONS, EVGENIIA SKIKOVA ALSO ON BOARD, HUSBAND AND WIFE. THEY WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN PAIRS FIGURE SKATING IN 1994. THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES FOR SOME TIME AND WERE COACHING YOUNG ICE SKATERS. SUR MAXIM WAS ALSO BELIEVED TO BE ON BOTH. HE WAS COMPETING AT THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT HAPPENED IN WICHITA. INA VOLAY SKYA, SHE'S A FORMER FIGURE SKATER WHO COMPETED FOR THE SOVIET UNION. SHE'S ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN ON BOARD. SHE WAS COACHING FOR THE WASHINGTON FIGURE SKATING CLUB, ACCORDING TO THEIR WEBSITE, AND A SOURCE TOLD REUTERS THAT THERE'S UP TO AS MANY AS 15 PEOPLE ON BOARD THAT PLANE THAT WERE CONNECTED TO FIGURE SKATING. THE U.S. ARMY SAYS THAT THERE WERE THREE SOLDIERS ON THAT ELLIE BLACK BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER AND THEY WERE ON A TRAINING MISSION. >> AND CAROLINE, WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK TO YOU THROUGH THE MORNING AS WELL WITH DIFFERENT DETAILS ON REACTION, BUT I AM WONDERING ABOUT, THERE YOU ARE IN WASHINGTON, ARE WE HEARING ANYTHING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THUS FAR? >> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUED A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IT SAID, I HAVE BEEN FULLY BRIEFED ON THE TERRIBLE ACCIDENT WHICH JUST TOOK PLACE AT REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT. MAY GOD BLESS THEIR SOULS, THANK YOU FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK BEING DONE BY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS, I'M MONITORING THE SITUATION AND WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAILS AS THEY ARRIVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO TOOK TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TRUTH SOCIAL, HIS POST, HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT TONE. HE SAID THE AIRPLANE WAS ON A PERFECT AND ROUTINE LINE OF APPROACH TO THE AIRPORT. THE HELICOPTER WAS GOING STRAIGHT AT THE AIRPLANE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. IT IS A CLEAR NIGHT. THE LIGHTS ON THE PLANE WERE BLAZING. WHY DIDN'T THE HELICOPTER GIVE UP OR DOWN OR TURN, WHY DIDN'T THE CONTROL TOWER TELL THE HELICOPTER WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF ASKING IF THEY SAW THE PLANE. THIS IS A BAD SITUATION THAT LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED, NOT GOOD. HE ALSO POSTED WHAT A TERRIBLE NIGHT, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. >> Heather: CAROLINE, THANK YOU. JUST STAY WITH ME AND WE'LL PAUSE AND BE BACK WITH YOU A","The American Airlines flight involved in the collision with a military helicopter was carrying 64 people, including several U.S. figure skaters, their coaches, and family members, returning from a national camp and championships in Wichita, Kansas. The crash also claimed the lives of Russian figure skaters, including former world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, and other notable figures in the skating community. The White House issued a statement expressing condolences, while President Trump criticized the incident, questioning the actions of the military helicopter and air traffic control. The crash has deeply impacted the Wichita community."
"E ARE TALKING ABOUT LIVE ATC WE TALKED FROM JOHN SCOTT AND YOU MENTIONED IN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TOWER AND BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER THEY WERE A HUNDRED MESSAGES SENT AS FOX NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THEY DID RESPOND TO THE TOWER READING THE QUOTE THAT THEY DID NOT RESPOND AND THEY ASKED AT THE OTHER REGIONAL JET INSIGHT AND IT APPEARS AND AS JON SCOTT WAS LAYING IT OUT FOR US ON THE ATC TRANSCRIPT RIGHT NOW GETTING THE CLARITY ON THIS AND THE WARNING WAS A BIT STRONG BUT THERE WERE TWO DIRECTIONS GIVEN FROM THE TOWER WITH DID YOU SEE THE REGIONAL JET THAT'S THE TRANSCRIPT THAT WHAT COUNTRY DID NOT RESPOND AND I WANT TO BRING JON SCOTT BACK IN IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THAT FOX IS REPORTING THAT THEY DID RESPOND BUT ON A DIFFERENT TOWER FREQUENCY. THEY WERE ON A FREQUENCY FOR HELICOPTERS AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE TOWER CONTROLLER WAS WORKING BOTH FREQUENCIES WHICH IS WHY IN THE CONVERSATION YOU ARE LISTENING TO YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HEAR HER RESPONSE NOR DID ANY OF THE PILOTS WE TALKED TO TODAY. >> WE USED THIS FREQUENCY PRIMARILY FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH THESE FREQUENCIES WILL WHERE JETLINERS AND THE AVIATION AIRCRAFT USED. IT COULD BE WAS ON A HELICOPTER FREQUENTLY THERE AND MAY BE TALKING TO THE TOWER AND NOT GETTING THE TRANSMISSION THROUGH. THAT IS ALL PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. AND SPEAKING OF THE INVESTIGATION I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD THIS BUT WE WILL PLAY IT TWICE THIS IS THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER TALKING TO THE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER WE WILL PLAY FOR YOU A COUPLE TIMES AND WE WILL LISTEN TO THIS IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT TO HEAR THEIR AND DID YOU SEE THAT AND DID YOU SEE THAT. IT IS A BIT SURPRISING. >> I DO BELIEVE IT TO BE ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WHO SAW THE EXPLOSION AND WHAT HAPPENS IS I TOOK A MINUTE TO LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE AFTER THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE AND YES, HE DOES FIRST SAY TO THAT DO YOU HAVE THE CRG INSIGHT AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GOING BEHIND AND FLY BEHIND THE REGIONAL JET. AND THE COLLISION TAKES PLACE IN LESS THAN FIVE SECONDS WITH THE LAST TRANSITION. >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT BUT THE HELICOPTER PILOT OR ONE OF THEM DIDN'T RESPOND BEING RESUMED IN THAT WINDOW BEFORE THIS DIRECTION'S THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TOWER ARE SO ARE SO RAPID-FIRE AND HE GETS ON BASICALLY IMMEDIATELY IF HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OR EVEN ON A DIFFERENT BAND UHF BAND AND THE TOWER WAS IN HEARING WHATEVER THE CHOPPER WAS SAYING IN THE YEARS COVERING AVIATION ANALYSIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME, THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND JUST SO WE CAN GET A CLEAR VISION OF THIS THE HELICOPTER HITS THE PLANE AND THEY BOTH GO DOWN. NOW WE KNOW AS WE ARE WAITING FOR A NEWS CONFERENCE ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN SET FOR 12:30 AND 24 SECONDS EAST COAST TIME AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A WORD OF THAT BEING MOVED UPPER BACK OR CANCEL. IT STILL APPEARS TO BE NOT ON SCHEDULE PER SE BUT HAPPENING AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THE PLANE HOWEVER WAS HIT BY THE HELICOPTER AND THEY BOTH GO INTO THE WATER. NOW WE LEARN THAT THOSE AIRCRAFT ARE BOTH IN THE POTOMAC AND AT THE HELICOPTER IS UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU HAVE THE PLANE WHICH IS BROKEN IN AT LEAST TWO PIECES WHICH ARE BE","The investigation into the collision between the Black Hawk helicopter and the American Airlines plane reveals confusion over communication between the aircraft and air traffic control. The helicopter, operating on a different frequency, did not initially respond to the tower's instructions regarding the regional jet, which may have contributed to the crash. The collision occurred rapidly after a brief exchange, and both aircraft fell into the Potomac River, with the helicopter upside down and the plane broken into pieces. A news conference is expected to provide further details."
"SO THIS IS A STATE AND FEDERAL RESPONSE AS WELL. TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO ON YOUR SCREENS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE MOMENT THE AIRLINER IN THE MILITARY HELICOPTER CRASHED INTO EACH OTHER. RIGHT NOW, BOTH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD ARE INVESTIGATING THIS CRASH. WE ARE NOW LEARNING FIGURE SKATING. ATHLETES WERE AMONG THOSE ON BOARD THE PASSENGER FLIGHT THAT COLLIDED MID-AIR WITH A MILITARY HELICOPTER RIGHT NEAR REAGAN AIRPORT. NOW, U.S. FIGURE SKATING RELEASED A STATEMENT CONFIRMING THAT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THEIR SKATING COMMUNITY WERE ON BOARD THAT AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 5342. ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THE ATHLETES, COACHES AND FAMILY MEMBERS WERE RETURNING HOME FROM THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAMP HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS IN WICHITA, KANSAS. THE STATEMENT WENT ON TO SAY THE ORGANIZATION IS DEVASTATED BY THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY. THE FLIGHT WAS CARRYING 60 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS. THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER. WE ARE IN TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING WITH 11 NEWS ANCHOR SEAN STREICHER AT BWI, TRACKING HOW FLIGHTS WILL BE IMPACTED THIS MORNING. BUT FIRST, WE START WITH 11 NEWS REPORTER JENNIFER FRANCIOTTI, WHO IS LIVE AT THE SCENE IN THE ARLINGTON AREA WHERE LAST NIGHT’S CRASH HAPPENED. JEN, WE’VE HEARD FROM SOME OFFICIALS EVERY HOUR SINCE ABOUT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT. WHAT IS THE NEWEST INFORMATION WE KNOW RIGHT NOW? WELL, THE LATEST IS UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAVE RECOVERED BODIES, UPWARDS OF 19 BODIES HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM THE POTOMAC RIVER. BUT THIS IS NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT THEY COULD STILL FIND SURVIVORS. I’M GOING TO SET UP THE SCENE HERE TO TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE. WE’RE AT GRAVELLY POINT PARK, WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE POTOMAC. AS I STEP OUT OF THE WAY, THIS IS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON PARKWAY. WE’RE ON THE SOUTHBOUND SIDE. THE NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC WOULD BE THEN HEADING AWAY FROM YOU TOWARD THE LEFT PORTION OF YOUR SCREEN AND ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER. THERE YOU SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONDER VEHICLES. WHAT YOU’RE NOT ABLE TO SEE IS THE WATER. FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, WE SEE HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR. AND THEN TO THE RIGHT PORTION OF YOUR SCREEN WHERE YOU SEE WHITE BRIGHT LIGHTS. THAT’S REAGAN NATIONAL. IT’S BASICALLY WHERE THE PLANE AND THE HELICOPTER WENT DOWN IN THE RIVER IS WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE OF THE RUNWAY. THAT’S HOW CLOSE THIS WAS. AND AS YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OF THE PLANE COMING IN, YOU COULD SEE IT WAS AT A VERY LOW ALTITUDE AS IT WAS COMING IN TOWARD THE RUNWAY. AND THEN YOU SEE THAT BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER BASICALLY JUST COLLIDE RIGHT INTO IT, AND YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION IN THE AIR, AND THEN THE DEBRIS FALLING INTO THE RIVER BELOW. SO THIS ALL UNFOLDED AROUND 9:00 LAST NIGHT. AND THAT’S WHEN THAT FLIGHT FROM WICHITA, 5342, THE AMERICAN EAGLE REGIONAL PASSENGER PLANE WAS FLYING HERE. AND IT INVOLVED THIS COLLISION WITH THE MILITARY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, WAS INVOLVED IN A TRAINING EXERCISE. NOW, AS FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE ON BOARD, WE’RE TOLD THE NUMBER THERE 6460 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS ON THE PLANE. AND THE ARMY SAYS THREE SOLDIERS WERE ON BOARD. THAT MILITARY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER. THIS IS A FULL OUT SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION. IT IS DANGEROUS. AND ACCORDING TO CHIEF JOHN DONNELLY WITH WASHINGTON FIRE AND EMS, IT IS ALSO VERY CHALLENGING. THE CHALLENGES ARE ACCESS THE WATER THAT WE’RE OPERATING IN IS ABOUT EIGHT FEET DEEP. THERE IS WIND, THERE IS PIECES OF ICE OUT THERE. SO IT’S JUST DANGEROUS AND HARD TO WORK IN. AND BECAUSE THERE’S NOT A LOT OF LIGHTS, YOU’RE OUT THERE SEARCHING EVERY SQUARE INCH OF SPACE TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYBODY. THE DIVERS ARE DOING THE SAME THING IN THE WATER. THE WATER IS DARK. IT IS MURKY. AND THAT IS A VERY TOUGH CONDITION FOR THEM TO DIVE IN. AND OF COURSE, THE CONCERN IS THE WATER IS ALSO VERY COLD, ABOUT 35 DEGREES NOW. MARYLAND STATE POLICE HAS SENT THEIR UNDERWATER RECOVERY TEAM TO ASSIST THE METROPOLITAN POLICE. AND ACCORDING TO GOVERNOR MOORE, WHO POSTED OVERNIGHT ON X, HE SAYS THAT THE MARYLAND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OPERATION HAS GONE AHEAD AND ENHANCED THEIR STATUS AT THEIR OPERATIONS CENTER. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT DNR POLICE ARE ON THE SCENE AS WELL. WE’VE HEARD EARLIER FROM SEAN STREICHER WHO IS OUT AT BWI. THERE’S NO OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS THERE BECAUSE AT REAGAN NATIONAL, THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED UNTIL AT LEAST 11:00 THIS MORNING. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING THIS IS A FLUID SITUATION, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY BE EXTENDED IF NECESSARY. I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE, IF YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN IN THIS AREA, THIS IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT BY ANY MEANS. YOU CANNOT GET CLOSE TO THE SCENE AND YOU CANNOT GET ACCESS TO REAGAN NATIONAL AT ALL. THEY HAVE EVERYWHERE BLOCKED OFF AT THIS MOMENT. SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. YOU SEE THOSE BRIGHT FLASHING LIGHTS ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER THERE, AS THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO BE VERY, VERY HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL PULL A SURVIVOR FROM THE RIVER. THAT IS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT. THAT IS BECAUSE BACK IN 1982, FLIGHT 90 CRASHED INTO THE 14TH STREET BRIDGE AND WENT RIGHT INTO THE WATER. IT WAS AN AIR FLORIDA FLIGHT BOUND FOR FLORIDA. IT WAS LEAVING THEN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT BEFORE IT WAS RENAMED REAGAN, AND IT WAS A HORRIBLE SITUATION THERE. IT WAS IN JANUARY AS WELL. THAT FLIGHT, THOUGH, WENT INTO THE WATER AT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON. 79 PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD, 75 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS, AND THERE WERE FIVE SURVIVORS. SO THAT IS WHY STILL AT THIS HOUR, THERE IS STILL SOME HOPE HERE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PULL SOMEONE ALIVE OUT OF THIS WATER. SO STILL A SEARCH AND RESCUE, ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATELY, UPWARDS OF 19 BODIES HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. REPORT","The crash between an American Airlines flight and a military Black Hawk helicopter near Reagan Airport has prompted a federal and state response, with both the FAA and NTSB investigating. The flight, carrying several figure skating athletes, coaches, and family members, collided mid-air with the helicopter during a training exercise. The crash, which occurred near the Potomac River, has resulted in the recovery of 19 bodies, but search and rescue operations continue in hopes of finding survivors. The water conditions are challenging, and Reagan National Airport remains closed. Emergency responders are working under difficult circumstances to locate potential survivors."

Over 300 responders have been working overnight, recovering bodies but finding no survivors so far. The search is ongoing as authorities investigate the cause of the crash and seek the black boxes from both aircraft. A press conference is expected to provide further updates."
"We continue to follow breaking news outside of Washington DC where an American airline plane collided with a Black Hawk helicopter. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is holding a press conference right now with the very latest. Let's listen in. Good morning. I'm Muriel Bowser. I'm the mayor of Washington DC. We are here at Reagan National Airport, uh, to provide an update on the tragic events of last night. I'm joined by US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, DC Fire and EMF's Chief, uh, John, John Donnelly, uh, American Airlines CEO Robert Eisen. The MY the Washington Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority CEO Jack Carter, United States Senator Mark Warner, United States Senator Tim Kaine, US Representative, uh, Don Beyer, as well as the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Pamela Smith, uh, and we are joined by first responders from across the metropolitan Washington region. I speak for all of us when I say and certainly all Washingtonians, how uh very sad we are uh for American Airlines, for the United States Department of Defense, and for all Americans for the loss of life um that happened with the collision of these aircrafts. We know that includes families from across our region as well as in Kansas and across the country. Uh, this morning, we all share in a profound sense of grief. I do want to thank the first responders who acted quickly last night, who ran towards danger, went into a very frigid river and have worked throughout the night. Uh, Chief Donnelly reported in last night, last night's briefing that we have a strong mutual aid agreement in our region, and those teams have worked together throughout the night in really tough and heartbreaking conditions, and we should all thank them for their heroic efforts. So we'll have several updates today. I'm first gonna um turn to the Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, and uh then you will hear directly from Chief John Donnelly with a situational update. Thank you Mayor. Again, Sean Duffy here, uh Secretary of Transportation, uh, we wish we were gathering for different purposes today. I just want to let you know that the Department of Transportation, the FAA, along with the White House, President Trump, local, state. And federal partners all working together on this incident in unison. I couldn't be prouder of this team that's been assembled, working tirelessly. Mayor, I want to thank you specifically for your work. Uh, a few details I'd like to give all of you, uh, and, and some of you reported this, but last night if you live in the DC area, you would know that this was a clear night last night. The helicopter was in a standard pattern. If you live in the DC area, you'll see helicopters up and down the river. This flight pattern is seen oftentimes when you live in DC. This was a standard flight pattern last night as well. The American Airline flight coming in to land was in a standard flight pattern as it was coming into DCA. So this was not unusual with a military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at DCA. And again, if you live in the area, you'll see that frequently with those two aircraft working together. As many of you reported, we have located the two aircrafts. The fuselage of the American Airline plane was inverted. It's been located in 3 different sections. It's about waist deep water, so that recovery is going to go on today as that recovery takes place of the fuselage of the aircraft. NTSB is going to start to analyze that aircraft, partner with the FAA with all of the information we have to get the best results possible for the American people. I would just say that. Safety is our expectation. Everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely, that when you depart an airport, you get to your destination. That didn't happen last night, and I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we have answers for the families and for the flying public. You should be assured that when you fly, you're safe. Thank you. Is that yours. Thank you, Secretary. Thank you, Mayor. I'm joined today by with uh Fire Chief Bonnett from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, um, and I'm John Donnelly, Chief of the District of Columbia Fire and EMS department. Last night at 8:48, the control tower sounded an alert which uh alerts responders to respond to a report of an aircraft crash on or near the airport. That sets off an immediate response from the airport authority fire department, from the District of Columbia and Metropolitan Harbor Patrol fireboats and other fire boats on the river in order to support that type of operation. Uh, very quickly this call escalated. It became apparent, you know, the responders realized that they had a plane crash, um, and immediately escalated to a response that ultimately included about 300 people last night. Uh, these responders found extremely frigid conditions. They found heavy wind, they found ice on the water, and they're operated all night in those conditions. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the agencies that responded in addition to DC Fire and EMS and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Montgomery County Fire Department, the Prince George's County Fire Department, the Charles County Fire Department, the Baltimore County Police Department, the An Arundel County Fire Department. The Alexandria Fire Department, the Arlington County Fire Department, the Fairfax Fire Department, the Prince William Fire Department, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Maryland State Police, the Maryland Natural Resources Police, the Department of Defense, the Joint Base in um Bowling, fire department, and uh the staff there, the US Army, the US Coast Guard, the United States Park Police, the Metropolitan Police Department, the FBI and the NTSB. Um, despite all those efforts, we are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. Um. At this point we don't believe there are any survivors from this accident. And we have recovered 27 people from the plane and 1 from the helicopter. Uh, the district office of the medical examiner has lead on reuniting these bodies and these people with their loved ones, and we will continue to work to find all the bodies and collect them and reunite them with their loved ones. We should also acknowledge that the Virginia medical examiner and the Army medical examiner are involved in this operation and a very important part of getting people identified, so. Our hearts are certainly with um all of the crew uh in American Airlines and we'll hear from CEO ISO. Thank you, Mayor. Uh, good morning. I'm Robert I I'm the CEO of American Airlines. I want to express my sincere condolences for the accident that happened at DCA last night. We're absolutely heartbroken for the family and loved ones, the passengers and crew members. And also for those that were on the military aircraft. Our focus right now is doing everything that we can to support all of those involved and also the PSA Airlines team. This is devastating. We are all hurting incredibly. We urge any family and friends looking for information about their loved ones to call our designated helpline. And that's a 1-800-679. 8215 1800-679. 8215. And here's what I can share at this early stage. American Eagle flight 5342 operated by PSA Airlines traveling from Wichita, Kansas to Reagan National Airport, was involved in an accident just before 9 p.m. local time on final approach into Reagan National. It collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach. And at this time we don't know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft. Flight 5342, a CRJ 700 was under the command of four crew members. They carried 60 passengers, as you know, for a total of 64 people on board. In addition to local resources already here in DC, American Airlines has activated our care team, and that's a group of specialists that are trained to support these types of responses. These team members are on site are arriving soon. And additionally, we have members of our GO team that are on the ground here in DC and they're being deployed with resources to do everything that we can to take care of the needs of the families and the loved ones. Of the passengers and crew members, and that is our sole focus. And we're so grateful for the first responders. They've been working through the night with courageous efforts. We're actively working with local, state, and federal authorities on emergency response efforts and closely coordinating with PSA airlines as they cooperate fully with the NTSB on the investigation. I know that there are many questions at this early stage. I just won't be able to answer many, but we'll provide additional information as it comes. Thank you. I want to introduce the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority CEO Jack Potter. The authority manages uh Washington Reagan Washington National and Dulles International. Good morning and thank you Mayor. First, let me begin by expressing our condolences for all the victims of this flight and for their families. There's a lot of grieving going on and so we're very sympathetic to that. I want to echo what was said about the first responders. When there's a problem in this area, everybody drops everything and they rush to where the problem is. So I want to thank the chief, the entire team from Washington DC, but just as important, the list of folks that the chief described, federal authorities have been here in mass, and so a lot of effort was brought to bear. Unfortunately we weren't able to rescue anyone. Uh, but we are in the recovery mode right now, uh, and I just want to, uh, you know, last night I expressed the fact that we hope to open at 11 o'clock today and that is still the case. We're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock and again, uh, condolences to the families uh and uh thanks to the many, many who are still out there working very, very hard to complete this recovery. Thank you, Mayor. Um, I do want to acknowledge that, um, the Virginia Transportation Secretary is here, uh, in addition to the Alexandria mayor, uh, and I will, um, like to ask, uh, members of the Virginia, um, congressional delegation, uh, to the podium next, US Senator, uh, Mark Warner, uh, followed by Tim Kaine and Representative Don Beyer. Um, thank you, Mayor. Uh, I want to join with everyone else and express my condolences for the victims. For folks who don't live in the DMV. We are made up of a lot of jurisdictions Reagan Airports in Virginia. Across the river we have Maryland, obviously the district. But has been indicated by the chief when tragedy happens. All those distinctions between the various jurisdictions and our federal partners all disappear, and I want to again thank all the first responders. On a personal note, I'll just add that Literally, I, I now know I was coming back from the district. From a dinner to my home in old town Alexandria. And while I did not see the collision, Um, I wondered I've never seen this many. Red lights streaming towards the airport and across the river in Maryland about this time. Um my phone started blowing up and I realized that this accident had taken place. There'll be a time to figure out I know NTSB will have a briefing later in the day, but to the victims, our condolences to the first responders, our thanks. Um, the sorrow, thanks and questions. So sorrow, as all have expressed to the crew, to the passengers, to the soldiers, to their families, to their friends, to their loved ones, to people who are still trying to get information and unsure whether their loved ones have been lost. We offer our profound condolences to them and our sorrow for this tragedy. Thanks, I'll echo, Mayor, what you began with. When you see a challenge like this and you see people from so many different agencies, local, state, federal with different uniforms, different badges, but working in such a coordinated way even in the midst of a tragedy, it does give you a sense of appreciation and pride in people's willingness to. Come to the danger and work together and I started to see that as a local official 30 years ago in Richmond and definitely have seen it here and then finally questions they're gonna be a lot of questions obviously a lot of questions and that's what the NTSB's job is is to be an independent investigator of incidents like this and they are here we were in dialogue with them earlier today. They've been here since they got the alert and they will be doing the work and playing lead in. Answering the many questions that we have and that's as it should be, it's not a time to speculate it's a time to investigate and get answers to the questions we need and I have confidence that will be done. Thank you. Following up on the senator, I think grief, thanks, and service. With millions and millions of Americans traveling every year, we are all grieving, knowing that it could have been our loved ones, it could have been us, and our hearts go out to all those who have lost folks in the most partisan place also, it's, I'm really thankful that Democrats and Republicans, people from all over have come together to try to make sure that the people are served. As a local representative, I want the families to know that our office. is available to serve you in any way we possibly can through this time of grief and transition and loss. And then also just note that we're deeply grateful for the people who risked their lives last night on a moment's notice and spent the whole night on the river and the ice and the wind serving us and then finally, as Senator Warner noted, after the NTSB investigation, we've got to make sure that at the federal level and with the support of Virginia and Maryland, DC, we're doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen again. So, um, with that, it, it's been said already that the National Transportation Safety Board, um, becomes the lead agency in the investigation, um, our jurisdiction and, and DC where the crash occurred. Um, over the river is, um, concludes, uh, as we, uh, in, in the leadership role of the unified command as we shift to a recovery effort, uh, we expect the National Transportation Safety Board, um, to provide briefings to the press","Washington D.C. officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, and first responders, provided updates on the tragic collision between an American Airlines plane and a Black Hawk helicopter near Reagan National Airport. The crash, which occurred during a standard flight pattern, resulted in a recovery operation involving over 300 responders. Despite their efforts, no survivors have been found, with 27 bodies recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation, while local, state, and federal authorities are coordinating recovery efforts and offering support to the victims' families."
an American Airlines flight has collided midair with a helicopter a military helicopter in Washington DC the US Federal Aviation Administration said it happened whilst on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 900 p.m. local time the jet we understand was carrying 60 passengers and four crew whilst three US Army soldiers were on board the Black Hawk military helicopter president Donald Trump says that he's been briefed on what he has described as the terrible accident and went on to thank emergency responders for their incredible work police divers and boats have been searching the water now for a number of hours looking for survivors whilst the US Federal authorities have begun their investigation okay let's cross to our correspondent Live From The Scene maril Thomas Marilyn you're there Merlin you're there first off um just take us through the timeline of what happened so what we know is that a commercial airline the American Airlines collided midair with an army Blackhawk helicopter and as you said there were 60 passengers on board the commercial airline as well as four crew members and there were also three soldiers on board the helicopter as well and just in the last few minutes as well we've seen reports that at least 18 bodies were recovered uh from the river that's according to our official Partners CBS but just to say there are there is no official update on the number of casualties as of yet and this is still a developing story but that Collision occurred here uh at around 9900 p.m. local time uh and it happened midair and it um it happened as the commercial airline was on its approach to Runway 33 and the scene that you can see behind me is the airport itself so you can see the the blue and red Sirens behind me and the Blackness to my left and that is the river as you can see here and there is a flurry of activity as the emergency operation is underway we know that there are uh emergency divers and police boats and emergency rescue operations very much underway but just to remind you it's midnight here local time and so it's extremely cold and it's dark and that will make that uh rescue operation all that much harder uh and you know we're constantly seeing more and more official um police cars and emergency responders arriving at this airport uh and we are expecting to hear a press conference in about half an hour and we'll expect more updates regularly throughout the night as well okay Merlin let's just uh go back to the the crash itself um I understand that there has been some audio that's been released um from Air Traffic Control um we are waiting for for more information on that but what have eyewitnesses described in the minutes leading up to that crash we've spoken to people here at the scene um and they didn't want to be named but one did tell me that they actually witnessed the moment of the Collision itself so they saw the fireball uh of the Collision itself and it was a bright orange in the sky and then it fell uh down into what this person uh thought was the river and he heard a loud uh boom sound as the Collision happened um and he described to me how scared and terrified he was um that he wanted to fall to his knees just watching um the moment happen before him couldn't quite believe his eyes um and so there's very much a lot of confusion here and people have been arriving at the airport um trying to find out what's happening um some people who have arrived expecting their their loved ones to arrive on other flights which have now been um re rooted to other airports all flights have been ground um to a halt here there are no flights taking off or Landing here um at all in the next few hours at least um that we know of um but we'll expect to hear more updates as we go through the night um more regularly okay so let me just reiterate what Merlin has told us there is a ground stop it's referred to as a ground stop this is a traffic management initiative which means that aircraft that meet specific criteria criteria need to remain on their on the ground at their origin origination Airport so there is a ground stop in place at Reagan National Airport no flights coming in no flights coming out Merlin there are two helicopters that are operating in the area and this is part of the search and uh rescue that is taking place at the moment what exactly are those helicopters doing what can you see them doing they have I'm I presume very bright spotlights on board what have you seen [Music] yeah I can hear them weing above me now you can hear that sound um and they are just monitoring the situation and we know that there are lots and lots of emergency responders on site dozens of fire trucks and and police um attending to the scene as well as U divers which have been sent from uh neighboring states like Maryland as well uh which H which are part of the rescue operation and we also know that the US Coast Guard is also involved in this operation as well and this will be a massive operation um and it will will be made all the more difficult by the fact that it is extremely cold here the temperature is cold even in the air and so it'll be even um colder in the water as well where this rescue operation is ongoing as we speak yeah I mean it it's it's only a matter of it's what a week just over a week that we had the inauguration of Donald Trump and because of that truly frigid weather it was moved indoors what are the conditions like along the river itself at the moment was it was it frozen over the pomac river Upstream it is it is frozen in Parts here it's hard to see because it's so dark it's it's just past midnight it's very dark here um and as I say it is very cold and so those rescue divers and this police will be operating in very frigid cold conditions and as you said uh you know we've had a spell of that here in DC and that is exactly what um prompted the inauguration to be moved indoors and so you know the city is just recovering from that and so there will be some of the river will still be frozen over we've seen elsewhere some of the tidal Bas in other bodies of water in the city here are still frozen over and you know just it was just a few days ago that there was still snow and ice um on these streets as well so the temperatures are very cold and the conditions are very difficult,"An American Airlines flight collided midair with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., around 9:00 p.m. local time. The commercial flight, carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, was approaching the runway, while the helicopter had three soldiers on board. Emergency responders, including divers, boats, and helicopters, have been searching the river for survivors in challenging, freezing conditions. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a fireball from the collision, followed by the wreckage falling into the water. A ground stop was issued at the airport, halting all flights, as authorities investigate the cause of the crash."

The crash, which happened near Reagan Airport, resulted in at least 12 confirmed fatalities and a large-scale search and rescue operation. The cold, murky waters of the Potomac River have hampered recovery efforts, though divers have been involved in the operation. Air traffic control communication and pilot coordination are being examined, but it's still unclear if there was a breakdown in procedures or visibility issues contributing to the accident."

Pilots face difficulty with congested airspace, changing approaches, and visual challenges caused by lighting. An incident involving a helicopter and a regional jet is analyzed, highlighting potential confusion due to background lights and the complexity of navigation in that area. Experts suggest the use of traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS) and mention the investigation will include interviews and reviewing black boxes, which could reveal critical information about the collision avoidance systems and pilot awareness. The conversation also emphasizes the limited room for error in such high-traffic airspace."

The American Eagle flight, carrying 60 passengers and 4 crew members, was nearing Reagan National Airport when the crash happened. Several young athletes from the U.S. Figure Skating Team and Russian skaters were aboard. Authorities are working in dangerous conditions to recover victims, as the water temperature is extremely cold. Investigators are examining the circumstances surrounding the collision, including the role of air traffic control and potential safety systems like TCAS."
a massive search and rescue operation is underway in Washington DC in The Frigid Waters of the pomac river just hours ago a commuter Jet and an army blackhaw helicopter on a training flight collided in midair at least 64 people were aboard the plane and three soldiers were on board the helicopter several bodies have been pulled from the water and so far no survivors have been rescued joining me now is ABC's Alex Bret in Washington DC Alex what can you tell us hey so first let me Orient you a little bit we are on the departures ramp in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 and you can see this massive scene behind me that sea of red lights from all those first responder vehicles and then up there in the distance that is a search helicopter it has been doing laps performing a grid search here trying to look for any possible survivors of this crash and and that's because time is of the encep and uh right now as we're getting further and further into the night the temperature has dipped now below 40° about 38 last checked and so for any potential survivors that are in the the Bic behind me time is of the essence and because of that we have seen a massive response I'm talking about dozens of fire trucks uh dozens of cop cars from different municipalities and different agencies and also those uh search and rescue boats and dive teams now all making their way over there trying trying to find any other possible survivors thank you Alex I'm joined Now by ABC News contributor and Aviation consultant Steve ganard Steve thank you for joining us tonight you're a former military pilot how does something like this happen at one of the busiest airports in the country yeah uh Byron whenever the NTSB does uh investigations into mishaps like this they gather lots and lots of in uh uh evidence they aren't ready to say what caused this but these days there's so much data that we get immediately that we can begin to draw some immediate conclusion so we do know because we have the tower tapes that there was an Army helicopter that was flying south down the pomac as this Regional Jet was landing at just on Runway 33 which means it was just heading towards the Northwest so if you've been to DC sort of pointing at um at the Kennedy Center and so the helicopter is allowed to fly along the patomic as long as it stays at 200 ft the tower said to the hel opter do you see the Regional Jet in front of you the helicopter acknowledged we see it and we will avoid it now what I think may have happened is that that helicopter crew misidentified the Regional Jet that they eventually hit they may have seen another helicopter at night you have lots of Lights Out There the city of Alexandria the city of Washington and so they may have gotten drawn off on what was not their traffic and they thought that they were clear but unfortunately they weren't and the midair Collision occurred we're talking about a commercial jetliner and a military Blackhawk helicopter why again would a military aircraft especially a military chapter be so close to a commercial jetliner the helicopters are flying up and down the pic all day long and all night long because of all of the things that go on in Washington DC that require helicopters particularly in an emergency situation so in this case everybody seems to have done everything right the helicopter was where it was supposed to be below 200 ft they were talking to the tower the tower said do you see this the Regional Jet was on what we call short final so maybe under 200 fet the crew in the Regional Jet are looking at the runway and they're thinking about finding where their touchdown point is the helicopter is crossing right to left it's in their peripheral vision and they just don't see it and it wouldn't uh set off any alarm in in the uh in the Regional Jet not necessarily uh but and and everybody was talking to everybody and everybody should have been where they were and so the problem here was is that it seemed to be a misidentification by the helicopter crew when they thought they had the Regional Jet but they probably saw some other aircraft and they were thinking that they were okay when they really weren't we're in the early hours this case there's a a recovery Rescue Mission going on right now people are are are risking their lives in hopes of saving lives Survivor we don't know about that at this point but walk us through what the investigation likely looks like right now what are people looking to do what are the priorities right now right now Byron it's try to find somebody who may still be alive in the in the in the river um airports that are next to water have uh have crash fire rescue both for on the land and in uh in in the water so San Francisco LaGuardia at at Reagan so they had crash boats out there crash fire rescue boats out there immediately they had divers ready to jump in the water so right now everything focuses on doing the best to find anybody that might still be alive once that is no longer the task then it becomes the the task of the NTSB to figure out why did this happen St a final question if I may uh we are understand it was a moon moonless night in DC as dark as it could be so what the pilots have been relying on what they could see around them what they've been relying primarily on their instruments it would have been visual cuz it's a nice night here uh in Washington DC Byron and and they probably were on night vision goggles now I can tell you having spent time on night vision goggles over water it is really uncomfortable you think helicopters when you see them fly down the patomic before they're you know at 100 feet or less they like to fly low it's fine fun to fly low in a helicopter but in this case when you're flying over water at night you can't tell the sky from the water it's it's uh it's vertigo induced in and it's very uncomfortable so I would imagine that they were stepped up at that 200t level just because it was more comfortable and they could look outside and look at the Horizon more and and try to a avoid any kind of a spatial disorientation so that's probably why they were at an altitude where the Regional Jet was coming in in on short final so lots of things went wrong it was it was four or five things that could have been broken this this chain of advents could have been broken at any point and tragically it wasn't thank you Steve earlier tonight American Airlines CEO Robert Isam making a statement we are actively working with local state and federal authorities on Emergency Response efforts and the American Airlines care team has been activated to assist our passengers and their families we're cooperating fully with the national Transportation safety board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can our cooperation is without pause and we want to learn everything we can about today's events that work will take time but anything we can do now we're doing this crash is a terrible disaster in the first major commercial jet crash in the US in more than 15 years tonight tragedy at Washington's DC Reagan's National Airport American Eagle flight 5342 from witto Kansas coming in for landing colliding with the US Army Blackhawk helicopter this live stream from the keny center's Earth cam webcam showing the explosion in the air the plane carrying 60 passengers and four crew the Blackhawk confirmed to have three army soldiers on board tonight the US figure skating team confirming that several members were on board did you see that you saw that air Del 32 sorry um I don't know if you caught earlier what happened but um there was a collision on the approaching the 33 uh we're going to be shutting down operations for the uh indefinite future if you want to go back to the gates High gu you guys coordinate with company let me know what you want to do all right we're let the company uh talking to them right now yeah we uh we witnessed the whole thing authorities addressing the incident at a late night press conference at 8:48 um an alert was sounded initiating a reg uh a large regional response at uh 8:58 the first units arrived on the scene and found an aircraft in the water and began rescue operations emergency crews rushing to the scene diers in the pomac searching for any survivors they are working diligently and very dark in cold conditions cold water uh to execute this rescue operation so it's a highly complex operation the conditions out there are extremely rough they're dealing with uh relatively U windy conditions wind is hard uh out on the river haunting images emerging tonight showing the debris as rescue crews search for survivors Ari shman lives close to Reagan Airport report in Alexandria Virginia so I just saw the plane and I knew something was wrong because it was very very close to the ground it was maybe 80 or 100 feet above the ground banked all the way to the right um I saw that for all of you know this was maybe two seconds that I was looking at it I looked back at the road I looked back again and it was gone I didn't see any crash into the ground I didn't see a fireball or an explosion or Flames another eyewitness recounting what they saw but when we went to the roof it was Insanity police trucks ambulances um command Vehicles Ranken National Airport was immediately shut down with no flights coming or going an army official confirming the army uh60 helicopter originated out of Fort belor Virginia the airport director in witcha Kansas addressing the media I don't have the exact time of when the incident occurred but we were notified um fairly shortly thereafter it just breaks our heart to hear something like this occur and so it's it's devastating for everyone Kansas Senator Jerry Moran describing flying the very route the plane took himself many times I lobbied American Airlines to begin having a a direct non-stop flight service to DCA that flight has been in existence about a year we're going to know people who are on this flight know their family members know somebody so this is a very personal circumstance this is the first major commercial crash in the US since the kogan air Buffalo crash in 2009 there have been other incidents like the Asiana Runway crash in 2013 where two people died the last fatality on the plane was the woman who was partially sucked out of a Southwest window in 2018 this has been the safest period for aviation in history this crash will undoubtedly shake the industry it's reminiscent of another tragic airline crash January 1982 in air Florida flight crashed into the pomac river 74 people on board were killed five survived rescued from the icy waters the scope of tonight's Collision still unfolding you know when one person dies it's a tragedy but when many many many people die it's an unbearable sorrow it's a heartbreak beyond measure joining me now is ABC Chief Global Affairs correspondent Martha Ritz on Dangerfield Island Byron we are r right on the banks of the pomac river the midair would have occurred just behind where we are you can see all the rescue and Recovery Vehicles they have been out there for hours this is also exactly the approach that Regional Jet would have made along very calm Waters very dark Waters tonight approaching Washington DC you could have seen as I can now the Washington Monument the US capital A City full of Lights we've also heard helicop opter all night and watched them Circle this area looking for any possible survivors any possible rescue sometimes there were three up there at a time all had their lights on uh it is a very Grim night here on the banks of the pomac Byron our thanks to Martha joining me now is greater DC resident Jamie Lynn who witnessed from her own home some of the Frantic search and rescue efforts by First Responders Jamie Lynn thank you so much for joining us you live near Reagan Airport what is it like there right now so right now it is still a very active scene um still hearing just as much if not more noise from emergency response specifically now I've heard uh quite an uptick in the number of aircraft over the area so just assuming that there's more helicopters assisting in um those search and rescue efforts now I know you said you didn't hear or see the actual Collision but when did you realized something was wrong it was it was a normal Wednesday and I went to our local um Arling Arlington Community Facebook group where our neighbors will often post news and I saw that the most recent post was an a crash and I rubbed my eyes thinking like here I look out my window because we have a direct line of sight to the airport we're just a couple hundred yards away and you just see this intense cluster of emergency response and that's when the feeling kind of hit that something really horrible it happened I understand it's a moonless night over DC so it's darker than dark there this evening could in your wildest imagination could you have imagined in this post 911 world with so much focus on Aviation Security that this kind of thing would have happened in the nation's capital that's what I you know was have been saying to my family and friends is that when you live here in in Washington DC in the immediate surrounding cities you kind of feel immune to to being um someone that this could happen to or see this happen we have one of the most Reg ulated um and and looked after air zones in the world we have all eyes on the ground and in the air 247 and so to just kind of feel like that that cloak of safety has been ripped away you you literally cannot fathom,"A midair collision occurred in Washington DC between a commuter jet and an Army Blackhawk helicopter, resulting in a massive search and rescue operation in the frigid Potomac River. At least 64 people were aboard the plane, and three soldiers were on the helicopter, but no survivors have been found so far. The incident involved a misidentification by the helicopter crew, who may have confused the regional jet with another aircraft. Authorities are focusing on locating any possible survivors, while the NTSB will investigate the cause of the crash. The tragedy marks the first major commercial jet crash in the US in over 15 years."

"want to show our viewers what happened in the seconds before the Collision please uh be aware that this is the moment before impact at the aircraft the Bombadier had changed its direction to a different Runway you can see the helicopter to the left Bombadier to the right moments later a large explosion both aircraft are now upside down in the pomac we just received audio from uh traffic

you go to Baltimore 19 aircraft were um asked to land at different airports just after 9:00 at local time last night this is the com conversation were told uh happened between those two aircraft a few minutes before landing traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilot said that they were able to do that uh controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33 flight tracking SES showed the plane adjust its approach to the new Runway less than 30 seconds before the crash an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the the arriving plane in sight The Controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later p25 passed behind the crj seconds later after that the two aircraft collided uh David uh we are getting the impression from the Kansas Senator uh that All Souls have been lost on both aircraft yes K I think the words of um Senator Marshall from Kansas will be the words we remember for a very long time from that press conference he said when one person dies it's a tragedy but when many die it's an unbearable sorrow he went on to say he wished there was much more they could do it's really hard when you lose probably over 60 canons at once it's a tragedy that we've lost them until that point the only suggestion of fatalities had come from the US News Network CBS reporting that 18 bodies had been recovered from the body from the from the river but it would appear that uh there may be no survivors and that would make this the most tragic air disaster over the US capital in more than 40 uh years we've been processing a lot of information coming to us in the last couple of hours I think the most critical bit has come from the fire chief and the mayor updating us at that press conference confirming that it was 8:48 when the alert was sounded about an incident involving a commercial aircraft and a helicopter the fire chief said just 10 minutes later at 858 the first units arrived on the scene and began rescue operations about 300 responders working as we speak boats and divers working as part of a rescue operation in extremely rough conditions it's very cold and windy in Washington the temperature is expected to drop further during the night it's just gone halfast 1 in the morning here and he says it's an active operation that will go on for many hours so I suppose we've got three things happening uh maybe four things happening at the same time we have a uh search and rescue operation ongoing there were 60 passengers uh on the American Airlines flight four crew and there were three uh military personnel on the US Army helicopter all it would seem unaccounted for at this moment of time uh in addition to that there is clearly um a recovery operation to some extent underway now to if what we are hearing from the senators from Kansas is correct we also know that the Federal Aviation uh Authority and the National Aviation safety board have already arrived at the seene and commenced their investigation they will be Desperately Seeking to retrieve the Black Box uh recording from those aircraft the plane we understand is divided in two upside down in the water the helicopter the Blackhawk helicopter also upside down in the water so it's a very complex scene so uh we have a recovery operation in addition to a rescue operation we have an air investigation underway and we have the political response as well uh the president himself being briefed uh around the clock now uh in the situation room where he is expressing real concern about how this was able to happen how this helicopter found itself in the flight path is so close to um Reagan National Airport the vice president JD Vance also saying that he's monitoring the situation and praying for all of those who were on board and their loved ones and I think that perhaps is uh the greatest part of this tragedy that they were on approach to the short Runway 33 at Reagan National coming to the end of their flight from witcha Kansas and would have had people waiting for them already uh at that airport and those people of course are now dealing with the fact that their friends and loved ones may not be coming home","In the moments before the collision, the Bombardier commercial plane adjusted its approach to land on Runway 33 at Reagan National Airport, while an Army helicopter flew nearby. The air traffic controller confirmed that the helicopter saw the plane, but shortly after, the two aircraft collided. Authorities confirmed that all souls on both the plane and the helicopter, which included 60 passengers, four crew members, and three soldiers, are likely lost. The crash occurred in the Potomac River, and extensive search, rescue, and recovery efforts are ongoing in harsh conditions. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, while political leaders express deep concern over the tragedy."
"for. Good reason. Meantime, we'll get back to the Comcast news and go through some of that. But we do have this developing story that we do have to bring you this morning. And we say it with great sympathy, because there is a great tragedy that took place in the skies just outside of Washington, DC last night. A military military helicopter colliding with an American Airlines jet near Reagan National Airport this morning. The search and rescue operations continue in the icy Potomac River, where both aircrafts plunged after that crash. So far, no survivors have been located. At least 67 people on boards of both of those aircrafts, collectively, some members of the U.S. Figure skating team are believed to be among the victims. And we are all praying for a miracle at this point. Eamon is at the scene on the Potomac River. Eamon, walk us through what happened and where things stand right now. >> Andrew. The first emergency call was 8:48 p.m. Last night. Investigators were on the scene. Search and rescue on the scene ten minutes after that. We're now getting daylight here, just on the scene, getting our first live look in the daylight of. >> The. >> Crash scene. I can tell you that park police helicopters are now circling overhead. They seem to be orbiting that site on the far side of the Potomac River, across from where we are standing in Alexandria, Virginia. That will be the D.C. Side of the river, where search and rescue efforts are focused right now. Tragedy deepening this morning, as our NBC. Affiliate here in Washington, D.C, is reporting multiple sources to them saying that officials have recovered more than 30 bodies from the site of the wreckage here. >> So the death. >> Toll here is tragic and expected to get worse as the hours continue. Because we are now more than nine hours after this incident and no reports of any. Survivors have come in so far. And I can tell you also that the conditions on this river. The river is deep today. It is flowing quickly today and it is very cold. We know that this is the highest level the water has been at for days. The water is moving at its fastest rate since Tuesday last week. The water temperature just at 32ºF. Very very cold. This river was iced over entirely last week, to the point where you could almost walk across the Potomac River, something we rarely see here in Washington, D.C. So that gives you a sense of the conditions that crews have been working in throughout the night, as they try to hope against hope in terms of finding somebody alive in that wreckage. I can also tell you, Andrew, there is sort of an eerie silence here in this area. We are just to the south of Ronald Reagan National Airport, which is just to my right. Your left here. And typically this area every couple of minutes is awash in sound from aircraft, aircraft landing, taking off at National airport. It is very loud here. Normally today all we hear are those helicopters circling the area looking for any survivors, any bodies. So this is a very difficult scene. They say they expect ultimately, Reagan National Airport will be closed until 11 a.m. This morning. No flights in or out until that hour. And we are expecting at the bottom of this hour, 7:30 a.m. Eastern. We are expecting an additional briefin","A tragic collision occurred outside Washington, D.C. last night between a military helicopter and an American Airlines jet near Reagan National Airport. Both aircrafts crashed into the icy Potomac River, and search and rescue efforts are ongoing. As of this morning, no survivors have been found, and over 30 bodies have been recovered. At least 67 people were on board the two aircrafts, with some members of the U.S. Figure Skating team believed to be among the victims. Conditions in the river are difficult, with cold temperatures and fast-moving waters. Reagan National Airport remains closed until 11 a.m. today."
deep seek is a Chinese AI company and it is shattering the model of American capitalism even as I speak the whole of the American economy is now wedded to Big Tech without big tech there would be very little growth in the US economy without big tech there would be almost no growth at all in US Stock markets with big tech there is both and the myth that the American economy is in good shape is largely based upon the idea that the stock market is at record highs and that's all down to the value of the hype around AI artificial intelligence in other words and yet what we've seen is that a newcomer into the market called Deep seek a Chinese company developed with a tiny amount of money has produced a model of AI that appears to be better than that has being put forward by chat GPT which is the leading model of AI available from US tech companies to people around the world at present deep seek seems to be able to answer questions as well as chat GPT and as well as Microsoft's version of AI and the other various sources that you can find on the web it's done it in the most extraordinary way it has not used the high-tech chips that have been produced by the American company NVIDIA it has not used nearly as much energy to produce its answers as it appears is required to power those Nvidia chips and it has produced it on the basis of large language models which are much cheaper to generate and produce than those which are being put into place by the likes of open AI who are the owners of chat GPT there is something profoundly disruptive about what deep seek is doing as a result this literally shatters American capitalism at its very core let me explain why American capitalism is based upon three fundamental ideas the first is that whatever it invents must be protected from all forms of competition to the greatest degree possible so that the wealth generated by any invention is concentrated in the hands of the fewest possible number of people to benefit them most of all you can see the model it has produced the tech Bros as they are called the massively wealthy people who own the largest tech companies in the USA it has also of course given returns to those people who they have let invest in their companies but that wealth is still concentrated amongst a tiny proportion of people in the US these companies are all about the concentration of power in the hands of a few in the USA they've achieved this through the second characteristic of us capitalism which is to be as anticompetitive as it is possible to be the most important person in many US companies is not an engineer or a salesperson or an inventor no it's the patent lawyer the person who is employed to put in the path of potential competitors the maximum number of impediments that the law can provide to ensure that they cannot copy any element of the business model of the company and therefore pose effective challenge to it these lawyers who protect patents and copyrights to ensure that rents can be charged to the consumers of these companies way in excess of the real value of the products that the company makes because it isn't exposed to proper competition are the fundamental basis on which American capitalism is now built it is the deeply anti-competitive this then leads to the third characteristic of us capitalism at present which is it is grossly inefficient if you can protect yourself from competition to make vast amounts of money for a few people and to extract extortionate value from consumers you have no incentive to minimize your costs because why would you need to do so you have money coming literally out of your ear holes and therefore you you might as well spend it you might as well have that comfort zone of having large numbers of people work for you even if they aren't really required you'll still declare an enormous profit you will feel like the king of the castle you will see the rewards that those grateful employees send your away and you will feel good about it if you are the boss of one of these companies there is no incentive to be lean mean and efficient as a consequence and that is supposedly what market capitalism should deliver but in the case of the USA absolutely does not deep seek has shattered all those myths not only has it been put together very cheaply but it has adopted a totally different approach to the market it has actually made its source software open source in other words anybody can access it and use it this is the absolute opposite of the American model in instead of putting legal impediments around somebody who wants to use their software deepseeker said have it use it it will still be charging for access to the big language model that it owns and the big answers that people will ask of it but it's going to do so at a much lower price than us companies are doing for similar inquiries and it can of course afford to do so because it's using much less energy on Lower Tech this virtually shatters the whole investment strategy that has dominated the thinking in the runup to Trump's election that has been built around the idea that billions hundreds of billions will be invested in Ai and that will generate the growth which will keep Trump in office well suppose it won't now of course one has to have a sneaking suspicion that this might Al be very carefully timed by the Chinese government to destabilize Trump in the face of potential tariff Wars and I have that sneaking suspicion so I will put it on the table and say it's there but deep seek does however work I've seen models that have been produced by it and they are undoubtedly good in that case whether or not this is a strategy by the Chinese government deep seek is capable of disrupting serious parts of the US aai market and might even prevent the US getting the worldwide Monopoly of this type of activity which it's got in the case of Microsoft and Google and Twitter and so on those monopolistic Trends may not be capable of reproduction in AI if deep seek and its own Chinese competitors can produce something very different to that which open AI Microsoft Google and others were promising at enormous expense I have no idea where this is going I genuinely cannot predict and I don't think anybody else can and this might of course Al so all be a storm in a teacup that is a possibility but let's presume it isn't let's presume this is real if it is the whole basis on which the Trump appeal to the US market was built is undermined but something even deeper than that is true if American economic power which is based around Ai and its potential is shattered Trump's ability to create an isolationist USA backed up by Tarth barriers is also removed deep seek is something much more significant than being an AI model whether or not it is good in that role deep seek is challenging us capitalism to its very core and it's challenging the philosophy of the American right to its very core and whether or not the Chinese government time this to undermine those ideologies right now in the first week or so of Trump's Administration does not matter because it's doing it anyway and this could be very big,"Deep Seek, a Chinese AI company, is disrupting American capitalism by offering a more efficient and cost-effective AI model than US-based competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft. Unlike the US model, which relies on high-tech chips, patents, and anti-competitive practices, Deep Seek uses cheaper resources and an open-source approach, making its technology widely accessible at lower prices. This challenges the American economy’s dependence on Big Tech and its monopolistic practices, potentially undermining US economic power, especially in AI, and destabilizing political ideologies tied to capitalism and protectionism. Whether or not this is a strategic move by China, Deep Seek poses a significant threat to the established economic order."
"the H thank you for watching thank you for joining us here in our Hollywood studio on um I appreciate that it was um oh we have so much to get through another weird day in Washington today where a man who does not believe in medical science May soon be in charge of Medical Science Robert Kennedy Jr Donald Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services faced the Senate today Bob and his brainworm answered questions for three and a half hours yesterday his cousin his first cousin Caroline Kennedy daughter of JFK made a video opposing his confirmation and adding to the long list of crazy stories about this crazy person his basement his garage his dorm room were always the center of the action where drugs were available and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed to his Hawks well that explains why he lost the job at John juice I guess it's he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed his Hawks and guess what not one of the 27 Senators on the finance committee asked him about it today not one we've reached the point where these cabinet picks are so nutty the idea that one of them was making steuart little smoothies doesn't even come up they did Grill him on the subject of abortion and vaccines subjects on which he is very conveniently evolved since pledging allegiance to the calop and chief most of his defense today was some version of I didn't say the modna vaccine turned kids gay I said it turned some of them bisexual the hearing was Rocky to say the least and not just because it sounds like he he swallowed a bag of rocks Kennedy was accompanied by his wife the actress Cheryl Hines who sat quietly behind her husband as he attempted to rewrite the story of his life did you say that exposure to pesticide causes children to become transgender no I never said that did you write in your book and I it's undeniable that African African AIDS is an entirely different disease from Western AIDS yes or no Mr Kennedy I'm not sure if I made that okay did you say Lyme disease is a highly likely militarily engineered bioweapon I probably did say that did you say that covid-19 targets black and white people but spared yeah yeah that's we got to get to the bottom of that and um and then there was Cheryl's TV husband from Curb Your Enthusiasm Bernie Sanders who not only did he have a line of questioning he brought visual aids you have started a group called The Children's Health defense you're the originator right now as I understand that on the their website they are selling what's called onesies these are little things clothing for babies one of them is titled unfa unafraid next one is no vax no problem are you supportive of this I had nothing to do with are you supportive of these onesies well that's a question I never thought I'd hear Bernie Sanders ask are you supportive of these onesies and what is your position on bigy RFK did not denounce the onesies and I have I bet they sold a bunch of them because of this hearing too they're $26 a piece which is that's not a lot of profit and it's also why I will be selling uh are you supportive of these onesies onesies for a limited time only all proceeds go to me it's unclear if RFK has the votes to move out of the finance committee and onto a vote by the Senate and full but it appears that at least one prominent Republican is bigly against him RFK Jr is a Democrat plant a radical left liberal I'd even take Biden over Junior because our country would last about a year or two longer than it would with Junior it would collapse almost immediately what's that oh that's something he said before he put him in charge of polio now he's terrific I have a theory I think Trump is secretly hoping the Senate doesn't approve RFK I think Trump thinks he's nuts but he promised them this job to get his Endor but if the Senate says no he'll be like oh well I tried on to Dr Oz barring that we could have a health and human services secretary who puts Easter animals in a blender paired up with a head of Homeland Security who shoots puppies and goats this is quite a farm Old McDonald has put together for us team Trump is already in a big self-made mess after the poorly conceived order to pause funding on all federal grants and Loans which caused all hell to break loose no there was a tremendous amount of confusion and backlash so much so they had to do an about face on it this afternoon but they are sticking with their plan of offering most full-time government employees a buyout if they voluntarily resign the Trump Administration is offering millions of federal workers buyouts if they quit by February 6th they will get full benefits and pay through September 30th and if there's anybody you can trust to honor a deal it's Donald J Trump it's he'll probably pay them in Melania meme coin or something but I think it's interesting could we make this offer to Trump too I mean let's get him a shopping cart give him 30 minutes to grab as much gold as he wants from Fort Knox let him spend the next four years playing golf with Kim Jong-un I'd be okay with that at his Thrice daily press conference today Trump detailed his administration's efforts to crack down on wasteful government spending we are merely looking at parts of the big bureaucracy where there has been tremendous waste and Fraud and Abuse in that process we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas condoms for Hamas they say it's the best way to keep the goats from getting pregnant over there it's we um we've identified and stop $50 million to buy condoms for Hamas I have to say whoever's writing his lies this time for him deserves a race they are hilarious money is a a big thing for Donald Trump after a long one week of work he spent some time playing golf on Monday at his Club in Miami and he always seemed to me to be the kind of guy who when he does leave a tip makes a whole show of it to let everyone know how generous he is you know what I mean okay take this and split it up among the guys you can give the guys less money who's going to take you want to take it Ta on [Applause] that he's he's holding the money like it's a condom for Hamas or something I wonder if ice has looked into the employees at any of the Trump Resorts yet I'm sure they'll get to that soon it fair is fair you know these deportation raids are happening around the country right now they're going just about as poorly as we expected they would many US citizens and even Native Americans have been erroneously hassled by Ice imagine asking a Native American are you here illegally they were like no you're here illegally you've been here illegally for 500 years questioning Native Americans to ask if they're illegal immigrants might be the trumpi thing Trump has ever trumped meanwhile in Canada they are super excited about becoming a part of the United States I'll tell you they're even acting like us now last week Alberta guy got in a fight outside a bar it was a very cold night it so cold in fact that his penis became Frozen to the sidewalk which is coincidentally how also how GMO and I met right remember that yeah yeah yeah TMZ broke this important story uh this was the headline Canadian bar this weenie is not getting roasted man's penis sticks to icy sidewalk the headline could use some the weenie is not getting roasted is it's not very we have a great story you need a a great headline like um freeze Willie this Pig needs a blanket TMZ did get footage of the incident fortunately he's going to get a frost it's quite a commotion the police laid him down on the ground and pick them up and finally I don't know what else they could do but they just yanked up off the ice that's the old Zam berer North they call it a Saskatoon circumcision it's good thing it doesn't snow that much in Florida or this would be a daily occurrence maybe they they should become our 51st state we might need someone to take our spot there is a movement of foot encouraging California to secede from the union it's a petition and if 500,000 people sign it it could make the ballot in 2028 they have until July to get the signatures ABS this I think this is a terrible idea how about we figure out how to get out of the Dodger Stadium parking lot first and then figure out how to get out of the country because if we become our own country who's going to turn on our giant water valve for us I mentioned last night Donald Trump's been taking Victory laps celebrating turning a non-existent valve or to turn our water back on Smoky unbearable was added again last night too again he wrote the water is Flowing big time in Northern California the long empty reservoirs will soon be full thank you president Trump thank you me for solving an imaginary problem I made up somehow he managed to fit six lies in three sentences there the water's flowing big time also is how he lets his nurse know it's time to change the diaper but unfortunately for Trump his dumb claim was shot down by none other than his favorite TV network a reporter from Fox News Jennifer Griffin posted us defense officials tell me they did not send troops to turn on the water in California despite president Trump's claims overnight well that's it Jennifer no cabinet position for you I guess no one seems to know why or how Trump came up with this silly idea but to put it to rest we've decided to go to the source and Governor Gavin Nome is joining us via satellite right now to answer the questions thanks for speaking thank you dein Governor Nome for uh joining us we appreciate it welcome to the rodeo brodeo thank you so listen I wanted to ask you about this claim Trump's making that he saved our state by turning on a giant water spigot no that's a big knob BR there's no big ass spigot okay um that's right but hey what is that behind you then oh that's not water that's the Intercontinental wheat grass pipeline I see when it comes to water mother n is in charge and we just go with the flow okay all right but now lowkey the fires are under control thanks to the Reigns that I summoned wait the Reigns you summoned well let me be clear it wasn't just me who summoned the rain I convened a multifaith tribunal of climate Shaman and medicine they thems and after an intense transcendental cleansing orgy we invoked a sick ass atmospheric River and boom Shakra lakra rain I see I see okay well that makes sense so where do the fires stand now well check it as you can see this map is inclusively colorcoded to indicate how much of a bummer the fires are mhm Palisades class five total bummer okay in Malibu it's a downer but not UNS surfable all right in Zuma Beach is going balls deep okay I think that that's good then I guess but what is the status of the Eden fire no idea what that is well that was that was a a big one it was the fire in Altadena oh yeah right yeah oh yeah well there's no surf in Altadena it's legit landlocked Okay but well we're not necessarily interested in the surf conditions in these places oh well then I'm happy to report that my Vineyard is fine okay I'm glad to hear that but as far as Trump goes oh oh oh speaking of do you see me lay one on Melania I did see this check check this out here I am with Donald dork yeah and then there's the wifey and know she likey she's down to pound okay oh I can hardly say I blame her governor and what about this these endangered fish Trump keeps bringing up the Delta smelt oh the Delta smelts yes these guys look at that one kind of reminds me of that Steven Miller but you know with like more friends yeah yeah bro they are soups endangered and we got to preserve those little at all costs okay cuz eggs from fishes are so delicious especially when paired with a glass of bone dry calip Pine oh that is so tight wait wait hold on a second wait who is this oh that's one of the shaman who helped me out with the rainfall wait that's a that's a kinam shaman from January 6th yeah yeah yeah but he's chill now oh okay chill is all right hey yo Shamone can you summon me some cruelty-free chicken tendies yeah governor before you go what do you make of this movement to have California secede from the United States oh I'm about it about it slim jim just off the Dome what do you think about the Republic of ginan as a name yeah I hate it I guess okay okay we'll Workshop it okay but I do know that if this does happen we're switching olivar dinero to ketas coin to what to ke what is Kus coin it's the Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony ketas sick new crypto and it's going to the Moon what I've got you got to get it put it in you what I've got you got to get it put it in you okay well good luck Governor I appreciate you taking time to talk to us I know you have a very busy week so I do I do Friday is the draft for my fantasy polo league okay well good luck with that all right Chachi protect your neck okay thank you governor [Applause]","Robert Kennedy Jr.'s Senate confirmation hearing for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services was marked by controversy, with his past controversial statements and beliefs about vaccines and health issues being scrutinized. Despite facing tough questioning, including from his cousin Caroline Kennedy and Senator Bernie Sanders, he defended his positions, often with inconsistent explanations. Meanwhile, President Trump's administration faced internal challenges, including a poorly received proposal to pause federal grants and loans and offering buyouts to federal employees. Trump also made bizarre claims, including taking credit for turning on California’s water supply and misrepresenting efforts to combat fires, which were ridiculed by both the media and officials. Trump’s interactions and policies continued to stir confusion, while other political developments, like California’s potential secession, gained attention."
which is the best off-road the new Toyota Land Cruiser The Good Old Land Rover Defender or a Jeep Wrangler well we're going to find out by comparing them in a series of off-road challenges off I'm Matt Watson and you're watching carwow I'm going to tell you how this is going to work so we're going to Mark each card depending on how they perform in each test the one that wins the test gets three points the one that comes second gets two points the one that comes last gets one point though if a vehicle doesn't finish a challenge it get no points the one with the most points at the end wins so this first challenge is a drag race up this hill I'm not confident about this I've got the heaviest car I've got the least power I'm on the most muddy part of the track and I'm on allterrain tires whereas the other two are on mud tires if this wins it's a miracle I know you Tire of Fanboys get mad this is not fair this is not fair Tires Tires Tires but here we are these are the tires that Toyota sent on the car and they knew what we were doing with it those tires on the Jeep they're the ones that are ordered with it and the Land Rover has some similar ties to what you can order with it they're not the standard ones they're upgraded like off-road tires but they're similar to those just a different brand anyway let's do this I'm just making excuses before I get going right then team so in the Jeep we have the Lovely Sam lovely racing driver Sam who can also drive cars Offroad the jum you can do any form of driving that you want you can even drive cattle and sheep aren you only Irish cattle and sheep and in the Land Rover driving his own car is hello Matt it's Andy hello again Andy um you didn't bring your 458 Special to this event this time it's a bit weird what why not yeah I thought i' been some a little bit more suited to conquer this event right let's do it Graham we've got the beautiful Graham he's going to be judging everything he's our off-road expert and he's about to start the race 2 1 [Music] wo Victory bloody out [Music] uh Andy are you still with us yeah I'm still here it's a bit slippery at the top Andy was above me I don't think anyone is going to push that car as hard as you are today I wouldn't even treat a press vehicle like that anyway clear wind for the Land Cruiser anything you'd like to say sam he was genuinely above me Toyota I mean what I'm not even on like the proper tires no just gripped and way it went three points to the Toyota two to the Jeep no his Defender was second way third whoa whoa whoa Sam what he beat you I know he did well done Andy it was worth it Well Done representing Land Rover there three to the Toyota two to the Land Rover and one to the Jeep for this next challenge we're going to test the cars agility their mobility and of course just how much punishment they can soak up so we're going to drive through this little bit in the woods go round a fre to come out the other end and Graham will be timing us on the fastest car wins okay then Graham take it away 2 1 terrible start Sam that's good through there whoa who watch it mate [Music] gram what time did we get there 16.2 second considering his start was rubbish that's really good okay Andy go on Graham count him in 2 1 better startop the Sam we're not going quite as fast now I thought Andy would absolutely be pedal to the metal this car slightly bigger turning circle of 12.8 which is the same as this Land Cruiser he's made it R quite gingerly he hasn't beaten some he took that quite steady yeah that's over 20 seconds isn't it 20.68 20.68 so I'm going be tactical I don't think I can beat Sam but I think I can beat that 3 2 1 come on get around get Get Grip Get Grip doesn't got grip bloody hell this is absolutely me absolutely it my tires that really went against me I got beaten didn't I 23 I just understeered at the top I was going in too quickly so I couldn't make it round the turn and that knackered me so I went two wheel high rear wheel drive that's why had such a bad start but I drifted around the top I don't have the option to go rear wheel drive anyway scores we've got three two one yeah 3 2 1 so wait a minute it's all Square Four Points each interesting testing the next challenge is all about controlling the vehicles as they drive down a slope but not using any human intervention we're going to be using their Hill descent control we' all got them in their low range mode we've got their Hill descent controls engaged and we are able to change the actual speed of the Hill descent control in This Land Cruiser and in the defender gr's going to start the race this not a race the idea is to come last 3 2 1 oh yes how's your feet they're tuck back I reckon you could climb from there into here yeah Sam's a stunt man come on do some stunts I don't know I'm falling down the hill don't fall over I can't I keep my leg keeps hitting the stick steering wheel oh you rubbish stunt man I think I was ahead of you yeah you are ahead of me no but when we started you're a man of many complaints I'm just going to relax protest oh shut up Sam I think I'm going to win this it's just so chill I think you're on the grippy side of the runway Sam your wheels weren't slipping it was nothing to do with that just accept the fact that you didn't win grae do you want to come over here let's see if grem will fall over in the mud here's a little a remind of why I keep saying it right in so three points three points how good was this though I know road tires as well yeah shut up with your formal protest I'm on road tires so you got no excuse three to the Toyota two to the Jeep and one to the Land Rover that means that the scores are seven to the Toyota six to the Jeep five to the Land Rover right this next challenge is the rock crawl we're going to be directed by grahe over the set of rocks and the car that does it with the most finesse and the easiest will win so gr will actually be marking each of the cars and his decision is final all right we're all going to run in low range mode best settings for rock crawl so I think we've all got rock crawl mode I'm going to decup on my rear stabilizer bar the Jeep is going to Decap all both of it do front and rear formal protest gra just a quick question should I have my diffs lock if you want everything you can lock locked my chassity belt cuz Sam's about you couldn't afford me Princess how much are you it's got good ground clearance that and look at the articulation easy it's got a rigid axle at the rear rigid axle at the front it's really going to help it with this oh going to put my window up [Music] oh I mean that's what a Jeep Wrangler is made to do do you know what Sam that's the first time I've wanting to be in the Jeep and not this that was just so good it's going to be interesting to see how this Land Rover fares now with its fully independent suspension it does have the most ground clearance but it just won't have the articulation I don't think but let's find out it's got perhaps the cleverest traction control system really good Electronics in this car which will help it with this and if it gets close it done a good job because on road I mean night and day difference between the two you really do feel the downsides of having an off-road setup in the Jeep when you drive on the road cuz it's pretty horrid on road whereas the defender lovely that actually did really well okay my go I'm going to put my central diff in first and then my rear diff we are good to go low range mode here we go God I can barely see him over the long bonnet oh oh oh [Music] oh that was disappointing right in gram right was exhaust it was exhaust yeah okay did I take the exact same line exact same line so not driver error not driver error it's lost is it this yeah Defender won that cuz it didn't touch at all it was so good Jeep were very close second it only took momentarily on that first drop three points to the landro over two to the Jeep and one to the Land Cruiser that means the scores are eight for the Land Cruiser eight for the Jeep and eight for the defender it's level everything to play for this next challenge is called the steps and it's going to test the car's chassis articulation see how much wheel travel they have grahe is going to direct us up here and he'll be looking at the cars and gauging how smoothly and controlled they go up there he'll be looking for minimal wheel spinning especially when the wheels are in the air okay the defender is going to go first oh look at that front wheel in the air not spinning away just steadily driving forward that is a good job there by that Land Rover that did really well considering it doesn't have rigid axles it's Superior ground clearance is really helping it there then back down again please Andy the same way that you came I mean look at that I think this Lan Cruiser will over that point cuz that defender's nose is so close to touching look at that traction on that front right wheel just the way it's just managing the slip so good that was a piece of cake wasn't it Andy it's just too easy the confidence this car gives you in like everywhere you go is just phenomenal I love it over to you now Sam you have the most focused hardcore offroader here so should be made for this kind of thing no pressure Matt this is confidence it's going to serve you right if you spill that I really hope you do if you don't spill any you should get bonus Point blind me look at the chassis articulation on that jeep it just looks so cool confidence inspiring Sam stop showing off with your coffee I'm definitely winning this Graham oh oh oh oh don't spill your coffee sunshine do you know what happened there at that point in time that noise that was the sound of the Jeep losing to the defender that scraped as well they both scraped oh right we'll wait we'll wait till the end don't get carried away so we'll wait gr's final decision let all vehicles run fast S Bar off diffs on we're all good come on do not bottom out we're just walking forward steady oh this is doing so well so far so very very good from the Land Cruiser it's all down to this descent don't touch I feel like I might topple over now this is the bit where I might drop Don't touch don't touch didn't touch I'm happy with that gram come hither there is one car that didn't touch to be honest I was expecting this one to come last it's one though isn't it one no Jeep second second if you say this came last I'm going to have a it's second Sam calm down I'll take that there's a Defender though great you love Land Rovers let's just put this up because they're just going to continue arguing so it's three to the Land Cruiser two to the Jeep Wrangler and one to the Land Rover Defender that means that the scores are 11 to the Toyota yay 10 to the Jeep and nine to the Land Rover if you're changing your car then you got to check out carwow because there's nothing quite like knowing that you're getting a great price both when selling your old car and finding a new one carwow makes all the stuff that's hard work about car changing like the haggling the no shows and the nasty surprises a thing of the past lifechanging now if you want to go to car while right now I've put a link Link in the description of this video and the Ping comment alternatively you can click on the pop out Banner appearing in the top right hand cor the screen now or scan the QR code on screen using your mobile phone to go directly there car change car wow in this next challenge we're going to see how well these vehicles cope with a side slope one is a simple side slope so they're going to drive down there but then we're going to drive around the corner and just Crest at an angle over a slope once again gra will be marking them on their capability off you go then Sam I don't like it wow that's did so well I mean look at that side angle that is nuts that was terrifying I don't like that it's offroading stuff's horrible it was really good I mean you're at such a crazy angle like 45° almost no it's got to go over the side slope oh oh that looks awful that's an evil root Gro you bad bad man oh that was [Music] horrible oh stayed on the ground okay go on then Andy get lined up time for the defender that smashed it that did I think you might suffer from not having rigid axles Here Andrew a bit oh it's got one wheel in the air already see doesn't have the chassis articulation it's doing all right though I mean that's a crazy angle for such a tall vehicle so the maximum only showed I believe it was 18° great must have been,"The comparison tests the off-road performance of the Toyota Land Cruiser, Land Rover Defender, and Jeep Wrangler across various challenges. The vehicles were assessed on drag race performance, agility, hill descent control, rock crawling, chassis articulation, and side slope handling. The Land Cruiser performed consistently well, securing victories in the drag race and hill descent control, while the Jeep excelled in rock crawling and side slope challenges. The Defender showed strong performance in articulation and chassis control. Overall, the competition was close, with the Toyota Land Cruiser, Jeep Wrangler, and Land Rover Defender each earning competitive scores throughout the tests."
"this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion as reported by CNBC out of all the countries on Earth Vietnam will see the sharpest increase in wealth over the next decade why well it's because in the background they've been positioning themselves to become the new Global manufacturing Hub after China many companies are ramping up manufacturing efforts in Vietnam including Apple Samsung and Intel so what you might be thinking having the projected fastest growth in the next decade might be a nice achievement but what's the big deal well what makes this success story so incredible is that just in a single generation Vietnam went from one of the poorest nations in the world to a middle- inome economy to really understand how radical Vietnam's rise is you must comprehend its history the Perpetual struggle of war and how it all turned around for them in this episode we explore the emerging Dark Horse on the economic Global stage Vietnam we'll see their struggles and how this massive transformation took place and we'll also see the challenges that it yet has to overcome you are watching cold fusion [Music] TV so what comes to mind when you think about Vietnam for many younger people it might be a budget friendly Southeast Asian Gateway with stunning Landscapes but for those a bit older it might evoke images of a poor country with dense jungles soldiers trudging through thick foliage ravaged Villages and scenes of fleeing refugees a land of hardship and strife this imagery was largely influenced by mainstream Western media it was all over the news but also films like platoon and Full Metal Jacket portrayed the brutality of the Vietnam War but now in the mid 2020s this is simply a distant memory today the Lively streets of hoochi Min City Vietnam's largest Metropolis are filled with the buzz of motorbikes and aroma of street food and an energy of a Nation on the rise in the country's capital Hanoi skyscrapers Stand Tall high-tech industrial parks Buzz with activity and luxury Brands line the streets the city's Lively atmosphere can be felt there's young professionals everywhere and they're leading the charge creating everything from startups to sustainable agriculture the Boost in Economic Development has contributed to a significant rise in living standards but in Vietnam there's a saying Gua low guwan which in English Loosely translates to in hardship wisdom emerges and this couldn't be more fitting for the story we're about to tell Vietnam was under French colonial rule for nearly a century starting in the mid 19th century Vietnam became part of French Indochina Federation of French Colonial territories in Southeast Asia including Laos and Cambodia under French rule the country's resources were exploited for the benefit of the colonial power Vietnamese people faced har treatment forc labor and heavy taxation after nearly a century of Oppression resentment was quietly growing there was a strong desire for Independence among the Vietnamese people the desire had given rise to a revolutionary movement and it was led by hoochi Min he spent years abroad studying and rallying international support for Vietnam's cause he was an interesting character standing at 5'5 he wasn't physically intimidating and strangely he actually respected the Dem values of France but he thought that the French practicing colonialism was hypocritical although hii Min stated that he didn't like violence if anyone got in his way he would crush them later revered as the founding father of modern Vietnam hoi Min became the leader of the vietman a communist-led resistance group dedicated to ending colonial rule the Vietnamese were finally going to fight back there was an attempt for a peaceful resolution with the French but after peace talks broke down the struggle for Independence culminated in war in 1946 it was a war between hoi men's resistance Army and French forces the brutal conflict dragged on for nearly a decade France's control over Vietnam was heavily weakened after the second world war in 1954 the French were finally forced to negotiate the agreement was to split Vietnam in half the North and the South and this division would set the stage for the country's next chapter in history so now Vietnam was no longer under French rule but the road to reunification was far from smooth the peace was fragile and tensions between the Communist North led by hoochi Min and the anti-communist South quickly escalated the United States fearing a spread of Communism in Southeast Asia began to support the South Vietnamese government but the USA's full involvement only made matters worse these are US soldiers fighting on Vietnam's front lines they are giving their lives they are not just giving their advice to a degree Never foreseen by Kennedy we hold the destiny of Vietnam in our hands and it holds ours in essence the war was as much a battle of ideologies as it was a struggle for control from 1955 to 1975 Vietnam was engulfed in a brutal war that brought unimaginable suffering and destruction the American intervention marked by extensive bombing campaigns ground operations and millions of soldiers and total made headlines around the world the Youth of America protested against the war causing a social divide locally between Generations the war in Vietnam is no longer simply their War to win or lose it's ours as well and it has become the most divisive in a 100 Years of American History do the results match the effort student protests in 1970 at Kent State University saw a brutal Crackdown from the US National Guard resulting in the deaths of four students students the event shocked the world and this incident culturally later became known as the official end of the peace era of 1960s America the war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon the capital of South Vietnam after the fall Saigon was renamed hoi Min City in honor of the North Vietnamese leader finally the country was reunified under a socialist republic however the newly formed Vietnam faced a severe hardship the economy was en rued infrastructure was destroyed and agriculture crippled more than anything the war left an irreparable scar on the Vietnamese people Millions died Villages were burnt to the ground and families were torn apart the land was scarred by chemical defoliators the effects of which are still felt today the devastation of this war is well documented but I just want to give you an estimation on the level of Destruction about 1 to 3 million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians 300,000 cambodians 20,000 to 60,000 Lans and 58,000 US service members died in the conflict around 4.6 million tons of bombs were dropped on Vietnam it caused extensive damage to the countryside and infrastructure over the span of two decades a total of 3 million people from Laos Cambodia and Vietnam fled their countries according to the unhcr 800,000 of these refugees were Vietnamese who escaped by boat later to become known as the boat people of Vietnam so to recap Vietnam endured nearly a century under French colonial rule facing harsh treatment and exploitation hoi Min led the Revolutionary movement for Vietnamese Independence culminating in the first Indochina War a war with his resistance Army against the French in 1954 Vietnam achieved independence from French colonial rule the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975 involved a significant us participation the conflict ended with the reunification of the country under a socialist [Music] regime so after Decades of fighting and destruction Vietnam was left in ruins it was one of the poorest nations of the world the GDP per capita was hovering between $150 and $300 in the late 1980s to 1995 to give you an idea today in GDP per capita terms that would make it the second poorest country on on Earth ahead of Bundi and just below Afghanistan back then in Vietnam the struggle to rebuild was immense the path to recovery seemed daunting under a strict socialist system many refugees did return to their country and the streets of Hanoi and hoi Min City started to bustle with activity again yet the air was thick with the weight of economic despair the people in power knew that something needed to be done in December of 1986 the government introduced a policy called doy Moy the doy Mo reforms meaning renovation or innovation were born out of necessity and a desire for Renewal the initiative led by prime minister Nan Kong hon aimed to transition Vietnam from a command economy to a socialist oriented market economy the initial steps were cautious but significant everything was State controlled so in that context here are some key points and Milestones this reform achieved over time in the north leaders of Agriculture cooperatives who were respons ible for managing Collective farming efforts were now allowed to rent out land to individual Farmers this marked a shift away from strict government control Farmers gained more control over their plots allowing them to manage their own production and keep any surplus beyond their quotas this change revitalized agricultural output and boosted the rural economy provincial governments were given the freedom to create their own trading companies breaking the state's tight grip on foreign trade private markets for agricultural products emerged and price controls over consumer goods were lifted this allowed trade to flourish at market-driven prices the reforms extend far beyond agriculture the 1987 foreign investment law took manufacturing facilities out of the hands of the state and allowed foreign investors to establish businesses own property and make a profit at the same time domestic private Enterprises were encouraged to be established this led to a surge in domestic companies however the full potential potential of these reforms was initially hampered by a us trade embargo which had been in place since 1975 seemingly a Remnant from the Vietnam War but when the United States finally lifted the Embargo in 1994 the landscape of Vietnam's economy began to change [Music] dramatically among the first to recognize Vietnam's potential were Global Giants Nike and Adidas Nike set up a factory in Vietnam just one year after the Embargo lifted Adidas was soon to follow these companies saw an opportunity Vietnam had a favorable investment climate and a cheap labor force something which isn't always good and we'll get to that in a sec but right now Nike works with over 100 suppliers in Vietnam starting in the early 2000s Adidas began establishing multiple factories across Vietnam by 2021 Vietnam had become the country's largest sourcing country contributing to roughly 40% of its total Footwear production in 2021 Vietnam exported foot Ware to over 100 countries with production climbing to around 17.8 billion us today many Brands such as Zara and H&M have factories in Vietnam and there's $455 billion of total registered capital in the form of direct foreign investments into Vietnam there's almost 40,000 of these foreign investment companies and within those companies over 1,300 of them are fashion brands when factories open new jobs are created for the local Vietnam people in 20111 21% of employees were working in the industry and Manufacturing sector today this is over 33% there's also opportunities for high- skilled jobs such as managerial positions though of course it's not all sunshine and rainbows though sadly there are companies that use exploitative practices and diminish the rights of the workers but despite that in aggregate there has been upward Mobility for those in Vietnam between 1993 and 2014 Vietnam raised around 40 million people out of poverty during this period the poverty rate plummeted from nearly 60% to 14% but there's still much more to be done and we'll touch on that later today Vietnam's economy is growing up 5.8% while the global average is 2.9% so what's going on here well in Vietnam it's mix of smart trade policies Savvy domestic reforms and Hefty investments in infrastructure and human capital analysts from the World Bank and Brookings Institute suggest that there are three key factors driving Vietnam's continued economic growth let's take a closer look at these points number one trade agreements and liberalization Vietnam has strategically opened its Market through key trade agreements joining the Asian free trade area in 1995 a deal with the US in 2000 and joining the WTO in 20 2007 are notable examples since then Vietnam has secured trade agreements with China India Japan and Korea a 2018 trade deal with other countries like Australia New Zealand Malaysia Singapore Canada and Mexico and another trade deal with the EU in 2020 now joined the list these deals Poise Vietnam to be a future export Powerhouse number two domestic reforms Vietnam has complemented its external openness with some crucial domestic reforms these include deregulation and an effort to reduce the cost of doing business red tape and hassle are being minimized as a result in 2023 alone Vietnam attracted nearly $ 36.6 billion in foreign direct investment okay so what does that mean well it's extremely significant because that's a 32.1% increase from just the previous year it's an absolute rocket ship but in saying that there's also the point of appearing tough on corruption it's a point which we talked about with the case of trong Myan after bribing everyone and stealing 3% of the nation's GDP she was sentenced to death it's a signal that Vietnam is getting serious even if it is just on the surface okay number three investing in capital with a population of 35 million half of whom are under 35 Vietnam has prioritized Public Funding for primary education and infrastructure it seems like they know the value of an educated and young Workforce Vietnam has always been an export heavy country its economy was once rooted in agriculture they had exports like wet rice coffee and black pepper but from 2008 to 2018 agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined as the industrial sector took off today it might surprise a lot of people but Vietnam stands out as a major player in the technology Hardware space in 2023 they exported 57.3 billion dollars worth of electronic devices computers and parts globally the country now ranks seventh in electronics exports this highlights a rapid change there's a growing presence of Global Tech companies such as Samsung Apple Intel and foxcon in Vietnam in fact such companies are flocking to the country eager to invest in and capitalize on its booming Market let's take a look at a few examples Samsung the company produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam they're planning to boost investment from 18 billion to 20 billion in the near future since 2019 Apple's total Investments have exceeded 16 billion creating over 200,000 jobs in Vietnam and Tim Cook is investing heavily in Vietnam analysts forecast that by 20125","Vietnam, once one of the poorest nations, has experienced rapid economic growth, positioning itself as a new global manufacturing hub after China. This transformation began with reforms in 1986, shifting from a command economy to a socialist-oriented market economy. By attracting foreign investments from companies like Nike, Adidas, and Samsung, along with strategic trade agreements and investments in education and infrastructure, Vietnam has achieved impressive progress. The country's exports, especially in electronics, surged, while poverty rates dropped significantly. However, challenges remain, including labor exploitation and ongoing efforts to reduce corruption."
"- [Johnny] This is a battlefield where both armies have the same weapons capabilities, but one of them has AI and the other does not. Let's see how a battle between these two plays out. In the process, we'll learn why Vladimir Putin once told a group of young students that whoever leads an AI will rule the world, and why The White House recently issued its first memo on AI, calling it an era-defining technology with significant and growing relevance to national security. To understand this, I've teamed up with Shashank Joshi. - Hello. Good afternoon, Johnny. - [Johnny] The Defense Editor at 'The Economist' who's likely one of the most knowledgeable people on the planet when it comes to this topic. - [Johnny] We're beginning to see artificial intelligence pretty much in every single decision made in war. So let me show you how artificial intelligence is transforming war. So let me clarify, this is not a sponsorship with 'The Economist.' There's a sponsor later on in the video. This is a partnership and kind of a dream come true to work with this newspaper that I've been reading since I was in college studying international relations. So I'm really just shouting them out because I feel an immense amount of gratitude for what they've taught me about the world. In addition to their excellent short form video, they've also started giving away access to their short form news app called Espresso for free to high School and college students who are over 16. Super cool. Again, not a sponsor. I just wanna get the word out here. So now let's get back into this video. - The examples that compel people the most are often the munition, the weapon system, the thing that does the killing, and this is the killer drone, a killer robot, but what I think is that often the key decisions in war are not the ones that the very end, they're not the ones that happen just before a bomb goes bang. And I think that's where AI is really affecting the battlefield the most. - Okay, so we've made these two hypothetical armies. Here on the battlefield, both of these armies are effectively trying to do the same thing. They're both trying to somehow get eyes into enemy territory, to find the enemy's most valuable military targets, to fix their exact location, to determine what weapons to use and how to properly target and deploy them, and then to actually fire on those targets, to engage so that it actually hits the target. And then finally, to assess to see if it worked. This is called the kill chain, and it is how war is fought. But executing this kill chain is not straightforward. It's the job of commanders on both sides to make countless decisions, often with incomplete or unreliable information, and victory tends to favor those who can gather the best information and make accurate decisions the fastest. So let's see how both of these sides approach their kill chain, one with AI and one without. Hey, before we get back onto the battlefield, I'm currently in my home with a sweatband on because I am exercising, which is something I have to do every day to be a happy adult. I'm telling you all this because it has to do with the sponsor today's video, who's Trainwell, which is a platform that connects you with a personal trainer who designs a workout for you that you can do right in your home using this very cool app. So here's how it works. Devon's been my personal trainer on this app for like a couple years now. I told him all my goals, which for me is like I just wanna be able to like lift my body and like be functionally strong. And then he designs a workout for me. It's all visual, which I love, and it comes not just with photos, but with actual videos of exactly what I'm supposed to be doing. This makes a huge difference for me for some reason, like at six in the morning when I don't really wanna be working out, but I know my day will be better if I do, having just a flow of looped videos telling me exactly what I'm supposed to do and then a button that I can press to be like 'I completed this workout' is awesome, and then I can give feedback to Devon. I can be like, 'Hey, the abs part was too difficult today. Can you make it a little easier tomorrow?' Or something like that. Oh, and if the personal trainer you're assigned isn't a good fit, you can switch it anytime. Devon has sketched out my whole week based on my goals, and so every day, there's a different workout. I still get to have goals, I still get to give feedback, but I don't have to make any of the decisions. There's a professional personal trainer doing that for me, and I don't have to leave my home, which like I just never got into the habit of going to the gym. For me, working out is a non-negotiable. I have to exercise to be a happy adult. And having something that takes away all the decision making and keeps me accountable, that is the key for consistency for me. If you wanna try this out, you can get 14 days for free if you use the link in my description, go.trainwell.net/johnnyharris. Clicking that link help support the channel, but it also gives you 14 days for free on this platform. I appreciate Trainwell for sponsoring today's video for supporting our journalism. We are now going to leave my home, go back onto the battlefield to see how AI is changing the nature of war. (dramatic music) - Well, militaries will use what they call sensors to go find things, that could be anything that looks at the world. - [Johnny] Both have all sorts of sensors that are looking into their enemy's territory. - [Shashank] The classic example is an electro-optical sensor on a satellite, right? And that's fancy words for a camera that is just looking at stuff. - [Johnny] They both have drones in the air scanning for targets. - [Shashank] A reconnaissance team on the ground. - [Johnny] They've got radar sensing what's flying through the air. The data from the sensors is being recorded and eventually is sent back to a central command center. This is where the decisions are made on what the army will do next using all of this data from their sensors. - So someone has to be sifting through all the satellite images. - And this is where we see the first big advantage for the side with AI, computer vision. - Object recognition has just exploded in how good it is. If you look back at the way that AI broke through and advanced around 2012, it was picking out images, in particular recognizing images of cats, and if you can recognize a cat, you can recognize a tank. - [Johnny] The AI command center is armed with computer vision software that is processing all of this incoming visual data and tagging it with what they think they're looking at and its precise location. - [Shashank] Now you have machines automatically looking over those images, picking out enemy planes, enemy formations and saying, 'Hey, I think with 90% probability, that I'm pretty sure is a tank, and I've worked this out on the drone itself, the exact coordinates it's at.' - The other military that doesn't have AI is doing the same thing, but without computer vision algorithms. - [Shashank] There's a lot of friction in this process. You had humans pouring over every single image. - [Johnny] They're slowly identifying their targets. A tank here, an airfield there, plotting them on a map, doing it manually. Oh, and by the way, this map only exists here in this command center. They haven't even started communicating all of these targets and intelligence to other command centers. Meanwhile, the computers over in this other command center are automatically adding all of their findings to a database that's in the cloud that other command centers have access to as well. - An AI-enabled army is fusing all kinds of data, mobile phone records, data from ship tracking websites, aircraft tracking websites, consumer retail activity, who is buying products near this naval base or near that airfield that might indicate activity. So you're fusing these vast torrents of data, spitting out anomalies. - So their maps are filling up much quicker, filling up with potential targets, and even context on each of these targets. - A commander who sees the targets then has to decide a lot of things. Are they gonna hit them or not? Is it valuable enough? What am I gonna use? Do I use a plane, an artillery battery, something else? These are all basically the bread and butter of any command decision. - But this is still just the beginning of the kill chain. These are hard decisions, but the AI-enabled commander has some help. A software platform has fused all of this data together and is starting to make predictions and inferences, giving recommendations to the commander, taking into account not only the target they're trying to hit, but also many other important factors. - I know that you have this many planes. I know that you have this much fuel on the airfield, this much ammunition. Here is the optimal way to destroy that target using these aircraft, coolant, fuel, oil, repairs, rest for the crew, food for the crew. These are all so fundamental. So a lot of the stuff that was being done in your headquarters by dozens of mid-level officers with pens, papers, spreadsheets can be done by software. So a human might be able to do all of these things, but it might take them like a couple of days to do it. The code can do it in like a 10th of the time, way, way more quickly. - So while the traditional army is still manually plotting potential targets, the AI army's commander is looking at a list, a list generated by his software, a list of targets. The software is proposing that they could hit a group of tanks that they found near the front line. They could take out a bridge that serves as an important supply line. They could target an ammunition depot that the AI believes that most of the enemy's ammunition reserves are being held. The commander evaluates these recommendations from the software and decides to target the ammunition depot using some artillery cannons that the software has confirmed have recently been serviced and have plenty of ammunition for this operation. He taps a few buttons on a screen, and a mix of humans and software start preparing to engage. This all happened very quickly. And over on the other side, they're just starting to assemble an initial list of valuable targets. The AI-enabled commander now has time to think about other potential targets. Its software is recommending that he send a swarm of drones with explosives attached to them to destroy this fleet of enemy tanks. And here's where we see yet another massive advantage of AI. These drones are piloted by humans, but as they get closer and closer to their target, the enemy sends out jamming signals to interfere with the connection between the pilot and the drone. - Suddenly, I'm not able to pilot my drone because there's all this radio noise overwhelming the signal. - [Johnny] The pilot can no longer control the drone. - What if the drone didn't need to have a pilot? - [Johnny] Thanks to recent advances in AI, this drone can start flying itself. - It is looking at the object, it's comparing it to a library of images stored on the platform, and it's saying, 'I know I am supposed to hit this thing.' So it locks onto the target and it says, 'I am gonna just keep going, I can maneuver to that target' in the final last 100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters of flight.' That's a real shift in the character of warfare when you have that precision guidance, not just on exquisite high-end systems, but on so many tiny little systems throughout the battlefield, - You can see where this is going. The AI-enabled army is able to pull off these attacks much quicker with way more information, all enabled by algorithms that are crunching huge amounts of data. So even though these two armies have the same hardware, what matters more and more is what's inside. - What really matters is the software. What really matters is the algorithm inside. - Okay, so this was a hypothetical and simplified scenario, but in the real world, this is effectively the direction that warfare is going. Relying more and more on software. Let's go through a few examples. Like in Gaza, where the Israeli military uses data from tapped phones and people's locations to algorithmically choose targets to strike. - There's a kind of AI target system generating huge numbers of targets per day of suspected Hamas militants. - [Johnny] According to six Israeli soldiers speaking to an Israeli publication, the IDF has based a lot of its airstrikes off of AI-generated lists, treating these target lists in their words, 'As if it were a human decision.' Now the IDF does dispute this characterization, but the point is AI algorithms are already being used on the battlefield to choose targets. Then there's Ukraine. - Ukraine above all is going to be the key test bed because that's where we're seeing some of the most advanced military AI play out on both sides, tested, experimented. - The major innovation here has been in drones, something we made a whole video about. More and more software and computer vision is allowing these drones to complete the final leg of their flight, to hit their target even when the signal has been jammed and the pilot has lost control of the drone. Here in the United States, we are seeing more and more tech startups who are preparing for this new form of warfare. One that relies so much more on sensors and data and algorithms that can make sense of it all to make wartime decisions. - This is all about autonomy, and that will be delivered more than anything else by software. - The US military has been developing an AI system that can take a massive amount of aerial and satellite imagery and pick out potential enemy targets, sometimes more accurately than humans can. The UK has a similar program, and because data from sensors is such a huge part of this capability, you see more cloud","The discussion explores how AI is transforming modern warfare, with a focus on its impact on military decision-making. In a hypothetical battle, one army uses AI while the other does not. AI enables faster and more accurate identification of targets, analysis of vast amounts of data, and decision-making, improving the speed and precision of military actions. The AI-enabled army benefits from automation, computer vision, and data fusion, allowing commanders to make informed decisions quickly and execute complex strategies. Examples from real-world conflicts, such as Israel's use of AI in Gaza and Ukraine's deployment of AI-powered drones, demonstrate the growing reliance on AI for military operations, highlighting its role in shaping future warfare."
shares in the advanced computer chip one of the wor if the Chinese company hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion look at these stock market charts from the 28th of January 2025 what you're looking at is a blood bath a blood bath in the US Stock Market of over $1 trillion and the cause the release of the deep seek R1 AI model from China the Chinese model is as capable as the best US models but it's free to use open source more efficient and most shocking of all it reportedly cost less than 3% of chat gp01 to develop just 2 years ago on this channel we were talking about an AI arms race between companies today that's evolved into an AI race between countries in the one corner we have the United States they have a long history of technological dominance but then on the other side we have China a country with a very different ideology and motives in this race to dominance it's not about weapons but it's about developing systems that are designed to think artificial intelligence this race is reminiscent of the Cold War some have even dubbed these events as quote the Sputnik moment of AI the White House says that they're looking into quote National Security implications of China's deep- seek AI platform and to top it all off open AI has accused deep seek of stealing its IP to train their own model it's all heating up with the United States pouring in half a trillion dollars into the Stargate AI project the global race is on and this ongoing battle could be one of the biggest stories in Tech this year as artificial intelligence becomes a matter of National Security the technology would be forced to move faster than it is today what a crazy time to be alive but before we get ahead of ourselves what is really going on here how did a company from nowhere do all of this is this all just part of the AI hype cycle or is this the real deal it seems like the whole world is playing catch-up since the release so let's try and make sense of it all you are watching cold fusion TV historically when technology meets a national security threat from an ideological opponent we get inventions like the computer and jet aircraft from the competition of World War II for example but this time around the United States was completely unchallenged in the field of AI for the most part but that all changed on January 20th 2025 with the release of R1 deep seek R1 which is free has performance reportedly on par with open ai's $200 a month model and this is performance in the context of tasks such as language reasoning mathematics and coding the free model also beats out anthropics Claude CET and Google's Gemini but what many people may not know is that deep seek does things a little bit differently to the current state-of-the-art models it's in part why it's so efficient but we'll cover these details later in the episode because there's no competition for that level of AI performance for free users have been flocking to it with deep seek becoming number one in Apple's App Store but here are the stats of why people's Jaws are dropping the AI was built in 2 months and reportedly cost less than 5.6 million to build the AI company anthropic says that 100 million to 1 billion is the general amount needed to develop an AI system from scratch and to that end meta plans to spend 65 billion on AI so creating something that performs this well with just $5.6 million is groundbreaking but all may not as it seems more on that later seeing much more um I think there were two very important things that people need to know about what's happening with deep SE Ki and the way it's being interpreted on Wall Street the first is it doesn't matter if it's a Chinese government scop or not the technological innovation of having an llm train itself through reinforcement learning is impressive the cost efficiency of doing inference with only s ion parameters rather than 700 billion parameters is impressive the possibility of being able to do more model training and inferencing with less usage of power and less chips is impressive it doesn't mean though that chip demand is at risk what I think it means is you're more likely to see an acceleration of AI everywhere all over the economy deep seek R1 being open source means that its code is freely available for whoever wants to use it and for whatever they want to use it for users can modify it as they please all for free this is totally the opposite approach of open AI which is pretty ironic this is all horrific news for us AI companies because it means that suddenly their costs are all out of balance deep seek with its 671 billion parameters can run locally on a stack of M4 Mac Pros in contrast investors and comp companies have poured billions of dollars into American AI servers after the shock of this release now it looks like us companies have been spending too much money using too much energy and charging too much for the services that they've been providing maybe in the future it's not going to be so much the models that would make the most money but the applications that run on top of them has this all been a massive mistake from us investors no one knows for sure and that's why the markets are selling off one bright spot for us companies though is that users of AI systems may not feel comt able in giving their data directly to China especially in corporate settings in order to compete Sam ultman CEO of the chat GPT maker open AI has announced that their GPT 30 Mini model will now be given away for free as for Mark Zuckerberg and meta they're internally panicking but it's not just the Americans over in China the effect is the same other Chinese Tech Giants such as bite dance the maker of Tik Tok Alibaba and tensent have freaked out and had to cut the prices of their AI model to compete and despite the low price charged by Deep seek it remains profitable while its Rivals lose money interestingly open AI told the financial times that they have evidence that deep seek was using the output from chat GPT to train its own model in fact last year they blocked open AI API accounts that they believe belong to deep seek suspecting theft the US government's official stance is that it is possible that IP theft has occurred it should also be noted that it seems like Chinese AI Developers are still managing to get their hands on topof the line in video graphics cards despite us sanctions but that begs the question who are deep seek and how did deep seek seemingly overnight build this [Music] thing for a company responsible for one of the biggest red days in the US Stock Market not a lot is known about the founder and the team behind deep sea but the story is interesting so far deep seek founder leang win Fang isn't from the typical Tech world he actually has a background in finance and co-founded a hedge fund called high flyer his company used AI to predict market trends and help make investment decisions and he was very successful at that and his fund now manages 8 billion but after his initial success he wanted more his next goal was to build quote human level AI in 2021 he started buying thousands of Nvidia gpus as part of his quote AI side project this was right before the Biden Administration began limiting us export of AI Hardware to China leang Advent spun off his AI side project into another company and that company was deep seek and the R1 is their latest model but honestly The more I've been reading up on the leang story The more interesting it gets so let me know in the comment section if you want to see a dedicated episode on the Deep seek founder so deep seek R1 was trained with reinforcement learning that means there weren't any humans who helped it learn and the method that deep seek uses for their model architecture is different to most of the other players it's a technique called mixture of experts Sky News explains it well quote where open ai's latest model GPT 4 attempts to be Einstein Shakespeare and Picasso rolled into one deep seeks is more like a university broken up into expert departments this allows the AI to decide what kind of query it's being asked and then send it to a particular part of the digital brain to be dealt with this lets the other parts to remain Switched Off Saving Time energy and most importantly the need for computing power the YouTube channel computer file explains further so maybe you ask it a very specific maths question what mixed of experts will do is have trained a specific part of this network a much smaller part to solve that problem for you and so you basically have the early stages will root the question to different parts of the network and then only activate a small part of it let's say 30 billion parameters which is a huge huge saving so this sort of shaded area here will activate and then that will produce your answer you can develop systems using agents like this where you have one that's trained to do this and one that's trained to do this and you just ask the right one right suppose I want to train a network to write my emails for Me Maybe it's very good at that and then I train a different network to solve a different problem and I just ask the right one as opposed to hoping that one model can do it so that's much more efficient to add to the efficiency is a process called distillation basically using larger models to train smaller models in targeted domains the result is equivalent performance with significantly less computing power and this was the big shock for AI developers and financial markets making Chain of Thought reasoning completely open and visible was an interesting choice open AI basically does the opposite does is essentially write down a step-by-step process of solving the problem and slowly solve it and then write down the answer you tend to get much better at solving problems that require multiple steps if you want to just what is why is the sky blue it will just regurgitate that pretty easily from text it's learned on the internet but if you're asking like problem solving skills it's hard to do in one shot so you kind of take a little bit of time to just to just take you know to just work through it now open AI pioneered this Chain of Thought um but they don't tell you how they do it because it's all closed and so it's not open AI at all right in some sense so essentially you see a kind of pricey summary version of The Chain of Thought but it's not the internal actual internal monologue which is essentially a trade secret what R1 is doing is it's doing a Chain of Thought which is similar to 01 but it's fully public they've released all the models they've released all the code you can talk to it you can see the entire monologue and they've also trained it with a with massively more limited data so as mentioned earlier things may not be as they seem that cost figure of $5.6 million to create the model may not be complete in fact in a paper released by Deep seek themselves they mentioned that that $5.6 million figure includes only the official training of deep seek V3 and does not include cost of Prior research experiments on architectures algorithms or data that does put a question mark on all the headlines we've been seeing that this thing was built for under $6 million but whatever the real figure is it's likely to be much less than what US companies have been spending in the latest news deep seek has also dropped an open image model and at this rate a video model will probably soon follow and it might even rival open AI Sora or Google's anticipated V2 in terms of search interest right now deep SE now outpaces chat GPT and it became one of the most downloaded apps on the app store and then towards the end of January things absolutely blew up and went wild China during Chinese New Year went crazy first Alibaba comes out with Quinn 2.5 Max it's a very capable AI that could one-hot this code animation just asking a computer to code an animation and then it goes out and does it is so intuitive that I think kids of the future will believe that this is how coding always worked alibaba's quen 2.5 Max outperforms deep seek and even GPT 40 in some tasks and then there's kimy K 1.5 released around the same day it's also a great performer is multimodal and can browse the web in real [Music] time okay before you all rush out to sign up to deep seek Please be aware of something it collects data such as chat history any text or audio inputs uploaded files keystroke patterns B basically anything you input into the model now open AI does similar things but the difference is that with deep seek your data goes straight to servers in the People's Republic of China so I guess the question is do you want to be spied on by the us or do you want to be spied on by China I can't tell you what to do but that's just a heads up but in terms of privacy there is a bright side does mean that deep seek can run locally on a machine without an internet connection for complete privacy here's the YouTube channel some ordinary gamers running it locally code things for you so for instance I can ask deep deep seek like write me uh code for a simple login P web page so at this moment in time it'll think it'll be like all right the user is asking for code to create a simple login page so first it's going to structure HTML then it's going to style then it's going to validate and then here it is it's actually writing me the HTML code so we're sitting in a world,"The release of China's Deep Seek R1 AI model has caused a significant disruption in the AI industry, triggering a massive sell-off in U.S. stocks, with over $1 trillion in losses. Deep Seek's model is free, open-source, and reportedly as capable as the top U.S. models but at a fraction of the cost, around $5.6 million to develop. The company’s innovative approach, using reinforcement learning and a 'mixture of experts' model, significantly reduces the need for computing power, making it more efficient and cost-effective than rivals. Deep Seek's success has shaken U.S. companies, prompting competitors to lower prices and consider giving away models for free. However, concerns over data privacy persist, as Deep Seek collects user data and stores it in China. The rapid rise of Deep Seek, alongside other Chinese AI advancements, has intensified the global AI race, raising questions about national security and intellectual property theft, particularly as U.S. companies struggle with high costs and energy consumption in comparison."
"this video is brought to you by ground news welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion think of all the major Bank frauds that you've heard of from JP Morgan rigging precious metals markets to Wells Fargo making up fake consumer accounts and scamming customers to all of the banks involved in The Reckless greed of 2008 a disaster that damaged the global economy no justice is ever served nobody goes to jail and no one in power seems to care but what if the opposite happened what if white col criminals were served the ultimate punishment this is the story of a woman who's just been sentenced to death in Vietnam trong Myan didn't murder anyone she didn't traffic drugs she didn't commit treason but what she did do was commit a fraud so enormous that it amounted to around 3% of the entire country's GDP in the past few minutes a court in Vietnam has sentenced a wealthy proper developer to death for defrauding a bank of billions of dollars 67-year-old trong Milan was found guilty of embezzlement bribing State officials and violating Bank lending regulations after she used her hidden ownership of the Saigon Commercial Bank to channel $44 billion of loans to her own companies it's been described as one of the greatest Brank frauds in history and how for over a decade did this woman allegedly steal so much money without anyone taking her down get ready for a wild ride as we dive into one of the biggest fraud cases in history this is bigger than teros or Sam bankman freed and it's a scandal that stained Asia's fastest growing economy you are watching cold fusion TV Trang Milan was born in 1956 in Saigon South Vietnam to a modest but entrepreneurial family scared her story really begins at the benthan market an iconic and bustling Hub known for its intense bargaining culture Lan learned how to hustle from an early age as a teenager she and her mother became a familiar site at the market selling Cosmetics together detectives always look to a corporate's early life for clues about why they did what they later did but with Lan her early life doesn't give much away there were no telltale signs that we know of and nothing that would point to the criminal mastermind that she'd eventually become Lan's negotiating skills must have really been something because by the mid 1990s she ventured into the property market and founded F Thin fat group around this time Vietnam was undergoing a transformation reforms had opened the doors for private businesses and families to compete but land was officially under State control so getting access to it would require some serious charm in Your Arsenal to sway State officials trong my land's rise was as dramatic as her fault in 1992 she met Eric trueu napne an investor from Hong Kong they got married had two daughters and built an Empire of restaurants hotels and properties across Vietnam and Hong Kong and her wealth exploded if we check out our typical profile of a white collar criminal this all fits the bill with seemingly no reason to break the law so that's why it's always so infuriating when they do they get greedy and as you'll see they just want more and more and more around 2010 is when things start to go dodgy Mrs Lan was a major player in Vietnam's Financial scene and her company was one of Vietnam's richest real estate firms she was powerful and had good standing with the community because of this and presumably her connections she was entrusted with arranging the merger of three struggling Banks into the Saigon Commercial Bank which will call SCB in this video the plan was approved by Vietnam Central Bank big mistake from 2012 she began to siphon funds she gave loans to herself and her friends and paid bribes to government officials to keep them quiet and from here her power would remain unchecked for now so aren't there supposed to be laws to stop this from happening well there were Vietnamese law clearly caps an individual's ownership in a bank at 5% but somehow over the years she ended up owning 90% of the bank so how on Earth did she manage to own 90% step one in Lan's multi-billion Dollar Bank fraud scheme set up thousands of shell companies she put the ownership of these companies and Bank shares in other people's name so a cursory glance from the outside would look like a healthy and diverse range of leaders and CEOs controlling the bank's subsidiaries and partners but in reality it was just her whoops and then it became an inside job Lan stacked the deck with her own people she hired trusted Associates as managers at SCB and instructed them to approve loans to her network of shell companies around the world these companies often had no operations or employees she would use fake contracts to move money out of the country as the scheme grew she needed more people to be in charge of her ever growing list of fake companies her husband her niece and other family members got involved 93% of the approved loans at SCB went straight into Trung my Lan's pocket with this setup Lan now had billions of dollars in customer deposits to play with imagine finding out that each time you deposit money 93 cents out of every dollar disappears into one woman's personal piggy bank to do whatever they please in the decade leading up to arrest Lan lent herself $44 billion in illegal loans so how on Earth does no one notice that much money missing well it turns out that people did Lan was a household name in Vietnam her position at Saigon Commercial Bank held her in great esteem but her never-ending access to liquid Capital meant that it was pretty obvious that she was up to something her Shady dealings were an Open Secret yet she passed audits from Big names like de white and KPMG with flying colors even if a regulator became suspicious and decided to dig deeper Lan would hand out bribes like candy take the Chief Inspector of Vietnam State Bank do Nan who accepted a $5 million bribe this was the largest bribe ever recorded in Vietnam and it was delivered in Styrofoam boxes to put this bribe into context top government officials in Vietnam ear around $1,000 per month a $5 million bribe could set the inspector and her family up for life but instead life in jail is all she received it gets even crazier over the course of 3 years Lan instructed her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese Dong from the bank and store it in her basement this was the equivalent of $4 billion us even if he withdrew all of that cash in Vietnam's largest bank note denomination it would weigh 2 tons moving this kind of money without anyone noticing seems unlikely but that's the thing in a country when so many people are struggling to get by a bribe to look the other way can be life-changing that's why so many people accepted L's hush money and why she could get away with it for so long however her luck was about to run out and her Empire was about to collapse Vietnamese authorities were undertaking a scorched Earth policy on corruption [Music] the thing about Vietnam is that it's a one- party state so there's not always an incentive or competition to keep those in power honest however since 2013 one of Vietnam's most powerful politicians n Fu Chong had been leading an anti-corruption campaign called blazing furnace trong realized that corruption within the Communist party was actually a threat to their power and in order to regain the trust of the Vietnamese people they needed to create an image of a clean government for years the Blazing furnace campaign focused on public sector corruption in Vietnam talk of cracking down on corruption wasn't new and probably fell on a lot of deaf ears including those of Mrs Lan so while Lan was busy bribing and siphoning cash the Communist Party began to take corruption in the private sector more seriously as the US China trade War raged on companies scrambled to find new manufacturing locations the Communist Party knew this and through the Blazing furnace campaign they promised to make Vietnam a cleaner and safer place to do business foreign business investment poured in and companies like Samsung LG and apple pumped billions into high-tech manufacturing the anti-corruption drive was paying off and Vietnam became Apple's biggest manufacturing Hub outside of China but there was a flip side to this anyone found to be corrupt was going to be in hot water and the more corrupt you were the hotter the water and trong my landan was the most corrupt of all in October of 2022 Lan was arrested and less than 2 years later she was sentenced to death it sounds wild I know but the reason for this punishment is both surprising and not so surprising hang tight I'll explain in a bit but for now the initial Fallout from Lan's arrest was huge police identified around 42,000 victims Bond holders and ordinary people who trusted SCB with their life savings the court trial was televised and was a spectacle like the country had never seen the 104 boxes of evidence presented in the trial weighed 6 tons land's Empire was so massive that it brought a once strong housing market to its knees property firms shut down in record numbers and authorities seized over a thousand of lands properties highrises across Hanoi and hoim Min City now sit empty post arrest even Vietnam Central Bank had to step in to prevent a financial meltdown they pumped $24 billion in quote special loans into SCB to avoid a bankr run the government also turned to foreign investors to help stabilize the situation quote without lending SCB will collapse if the lending continues the national treasury will gradually dry up end quote ironically some analysts think that the arrest backfired and made foreign investment skittish right at the time when Vietnam was poised to be the next Global manufacturing hub in April of 2024 Trang Myan was sentenced to death for embezzling $ 12.5 billion and that's just the amount the authorities could prove to put that into perspective that's like someone in the United States stealing $ 7632 billion land's arrest shocked the nation but the death penalty verdict even more so capital punishment in Vietnam is relatively common but it's rarely applied in cases of financial crimes especially with someone with no prior convictions so what's the story behind the move well there's a lot of perspectives for One Time Magazine published Vietnam sought to make an example out of Lan end quot and this makes sense considering the verdict the defendants actions eroded people's trust in the leadership of the Communist party and state end qu but the question is was L sentencing more about politics than the justice for a victims potentially some experts think that the Communist party used her as a human sacrifice just to show the world that they were taking corruption seriously if Lan had just received a live sentence the story probably wouldn't have made Global headlines and authorities wouldn't be able to push their narrative others speculate that the whole thing could just be a ruse a method to terrify Lan into giving up more of her stolen assets and accompli they think that if she settles the outstanding debts of $28 billion maybe she'll be spared in the end land pled not guilty and blamed her subordinates she admitted that she was involved in the restructuring of the bank but did not misappropriate its funds she also told the court that by her getting into the banking industry without sufficient experience and quote a lack of understanding of legal matters got her into the situation the courts didn't buy it and all in all 855 people were charged including Lan's husband who was sentenced to 9 years in prison and Lan's niece who was sentenced to 17 years two former Executives of the SCB Bank have fled the country and are still on the run before we continue let's hear a quick word from today's sponsor ground news Apple has made Headway towards its first unionized store in the US it's interesting to see how this news is covered by different outlets and that's where today's sponsor ground news comes in ground news is a website and app developed by a former NASA engineer she was on a mission to give readers an easy data driven objective way to read the news using this apple story as an example we can see that 54 news outlets from around the world covered the story The biased distribution chart shows me the political leanings of those outlets and I can get a summary of how the issue was being framed the left tended to be more favorable to the Union's perspective emphasizing workers voices and future gains meanwhile the rot focused on the deeper historical significance of the agreement referring to previous Union activities and Strikes for other more politically charged stories ground news is helpful to get the full picture of different perspectives scrolling down I can compare every single news article on the topic with convenient tags these

Vietnam where a property Tycoon has been sentenced to death in the country's biggest ever financial fraud case 10% of a country's GDP and nobody noticed but you're saying she bribed people but she must have bribed an awful lot of people for that to go either unnoticed or unchallenged I'm sure the officials knew about that but uh they were just they they just pretended to look the other way because uh her main Patron used to be a very powerful man he was the party chief","Trung My Lan, a Vietnamese property developer, was sentenced to death for defrauding the Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) of $44 billion, about 3% of the country's GDP. Over a decade, she orchestrated an elaborate scheme involving shell companies and bribed government officials to secure illegal loans for herself and her associates, diverting 93% of SCB's approved loans. Despite audits and suspicions, her actions went unchecked due to her wealth, influence, and connections. When anti-corruption efforts intensified in Vietnam, her empire collapsed, leading to her arrest and sentencing in 2024, alongside charges for her family and associates. The case shocked the nation, with some viewing the death sentence as a political move to restore public trust."
this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion Google is everywhere the company is just a part of daily life when you want a quick answer to something you just use Google without a second thought but what if there was a world where it wasn't just Google in that position but a whole host of other players that vision is what the Department of Justice in the US wants to see now Google has suffered a major legal blow after a US judge ruled it had acted illegally to Main contain a monopoly and stifle competition while generating huge profits the US attorney general described the ruling as quote an historic win for the American people in August of 2024 in an event called the biggest antitrust ruling of the century the doj has called Google a monopoly in the online search Market but since that ruling things have progressed now the doj are looking out ways to break up Google on September 6th 2024 a hearing was held to determine the plan for forward but in yet further escalation the doj is launching another antitrust case against Google in the coming days but in all of this there are still some questions here is this the beginning of the end for Google's era of online dominance do the government's actions actually help the average internet user or is there a bit more to the story might the Department of Justice be a bit heavy-handed on Google we'll have a fair look at both sides also stay tuned for the story of the Monopoly man all of that and more coming right up you are watching to Fusion TV so it's well known that Google dominates online search they make up about 90% of the search Market which has served them well Google makes over $75 billion yearly from search that's more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait Morocco Slovakia and Oman but recently this dominance has come into question in the landmark 286 page ruling of Google versus the United States the doj thinks that Google has gotten to this position due to unfair practices in other words the violation of antitrust laws so it's probably good to have some definitions before we go further according to the doj antitrust behavior is quote anti-competitive conduct that deprives American consumers taxpayers and workers of the benefits of competition end quote and part of this is a Monopoly Monopoly status isn't legally defined and it depends where you look but at 50 to 60% market share you're teetering on the edge and such a company may endure scrutiny at 70 to 75% you're most definitely a monopoly but the thing is the triggering of antitrust action also depends on the company's Behavior but 90% market share is definitely going to attract Regulators in any functioning government [Music] I read through some of the case document and there's a lot but there's two main things I want to cover Google charging higher prices because there's no competition and paying to keep the competition away and remember that these are not my opinions just the facts from the case an interesting note in the paper was that apparently in 2020 Google conducted a study to see what would happen to their bottom line if it quote were to significantly reduce the quality of its search product end quot the conclusion was that even if the company made search bad the revenue from search would still be fine on this the judge wrote quote the fact that Google can make product changes without concern that its users might go elsewhere is something only a firm with Monopoly power could do okay so let's dig deeper the case CES that since there's no other game in town for search advertising advertisers had no choice but Google in order to reach more people Google could then increase prices the other problem according to the ruling was that prices were raised incrementally to blend in with normal Market fluctuations and this was to reduce the likelihood of advertisers noticing incremental price changes led to consistent Revenue growth without significant complaints from advertisers Google went as far as to do internal studies to show that advertisers did indeed not notice and just thought that the price hikes were just part of the overall Market the doj also cites that Google tuned their mechanism for determining ad costs quote Google adjust the parameters of the auction function how advertisers bid for adspace in order to improve long-term Revenue this work has resulted in products which add several billion dollars in incremental Revenue annually end quote and this next point is pretty interesting the ruling goes on to say that when Google grew concerned about meeting its Revenue targets a code yellow was called basically it was an instruction to get all hands on deck to subtly raise Advertiser pricing without too many noticing the company knew they could do this yet again from more internal studies showing that advertisers would pay more than they currently were without leaving the judge stated quote the trial evidence firmly establishes Google's Monopoly power and has enabled Google to increase text ad prices without any meaningful competitive constraint I know what some of you would be saying well who cares about advertisers getting fleeced all advertisers do is track you and follow you around on the off chance that you'll buy something that you've previously been Googling and there is an argument to be made there but there's a second order consequence if advertisers have to pay higher cost to Google they can then turn around and pass some of that cost onto you the consumer Google has been paying Apple and Samsung billions of dollars annually to install Google as the default search engine on their smartphones and web browsers quote in return for exclusive and non-exclusive default placements Google pays Apple $20 billion in 2022 end quote this is apparently quote almost double the payment Google made in 2020 which at the time was 17.5% of Apple's operating profit so why would Google do this well consumers tend to buy more things on their phone and for iPhones quote Google receives almost 95% of General search queries end quote and with billions of iPhones out there that's a lot of ads which means a lot of Revenue the doj didn't like that quote Google's distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search Services market and impairs Rivals opportunities to compete end quote the doj thinks that it's actually the Monopoly on the phone browsing Market that enabled Google to consistently raise the prices of online advertising without consequences as we discussed earlier it turns out that back in the days of Steve Jobs and for a little bit after that Apple was looking to make their own search engine but they had a search Project in the works when Steve Jobs was in charge over there they were looking at search because he had such an ax to grind with Eric Schmidt because they launched Android and he kicked Eric Schmidt off the board and there was a lot of hand ringing there I think apple is and i' I've heard this from folks around Apple I believe Apple's going to launch their own search engine and compete heads up with Google but now Google has Apple in golden handcuffs with a$ 20 billion yearly deal in the contract apple is basically not allowed to innovate on any of their own search engines the judge also scolds Google for destroying and hiding evidence they allege that Google trained employees to not leave a paper trail or quote bad evidence behind quote any company that puts the owners on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own Peril Google avoided sanctions in this case it may not be so lucky in the next one entrepreneur and angel investor David Friedberg gives an interesting Viewpoint in his View the ruling is more anti- suuccess than it is anti-consumer I'll also say it just feels like the tenor of all of this is anti- success and not anti-competition and anything that's kind of successful or big is automatically deemed to be a monopoly and I think we really have to kind of understand how are consumers and the market for competition being affected by having all these things together and that's what should really be focused on and studied not just the fact that something is big and successful Jason kakanis another angel investor states that Google does not in fact have a monopoly on the ads business meta Amazon and Tik Tok are also huge players they do have a massive Monopoly in search that's absolutely true and the justice department I think is um well within their rights to to take a deep dive on that they don't have it in ads if you look at the competition for Google in advertising you got meta Tik Tok and Amazon which have very very significant advertising businesses and then like a bunch of new players um which are referred to basically as the shopping cart networks that's Uber instacart door Dash Etc and so when you look at this it really does rhyme with what happened with Microsoft they're two decades late on this the the search Monopoly has been squeezed for every dollar and to build every subcomponent of Google's Monopoly at the time of the antitrust ruling Google argued that its distribution deals are common in the business World they equated paying for search engine default privileges on phones to be the same as if a food manufacturer pays to promote products at ey level in a grocery store aisle the way Google sees it if you don't like Google you can switch the default engine on your device but people don't switch says Google because they prefer Google Google has also stated that they're going to appeal the decision of them being a monopoly on the flip side when it comes to the default status of Google and iPhones Apple themselves aren't a fan of Bing Eddie Q Apple's senior vice president said quote I don't believe there's a price in the world that Microsoft could offer us to set Bing as the default in Safari over Google they offered to give us Bing for free they could give us the whole company end quote but also take that with a grain of salt because it might be in Apple's best interest to defend Google it's actually written in that 20 billion contract with Google part of the contract obligates both Google and apple to defend this agreement quote in response to regulatory actions I.E doj antitrust lawsuits just like this one okay okay so that's the ruling but it doesn't leave you satisfied what does this all mean and what happens next and what about the calls to break up Google Justice Department officials are discussing their options including breaking up Google so that their Chrome browser could be sold as a separate company same with Google's Android smartphone operating system other options may include even separating YouTube from Google Department of Justice is considering breaking up Google after winning an antitrust case against the search giant just last week a hearing is said for early September you know maybe um forcing Google to divest the Android operating system and the Chrome browser those are two of the suggestions that we had heard from people with knowledge of this case even if you don't actually get a breakup it can divert resources Talent money uh Capital towards fighting these antitrust battles and make a company miss out on Innovation that led to what a l decade at Microsoft so that is the worry here for Google as well but the idea of a breakup has been raised that the doj is going to ask the judge to consider but there's a possibility that Google could even break itself up the last time something similar happened was back in 1982 When AT&T broke itself up and this was to dispel the antitrust pressure from the government Google has the opportunity to do something really interesting here which is get ahead of the curve and break itself up before the political system forces that onto it the big categories would be search advertising and YouTube and I think that would have two big economic benefits for shareholders one is you unlock value by deong glomera second once you break up the company into these pieces there's less places for employees who aren't doing anything to hide you know for all this bureaucracy to hide I mean look Google is famous for employees who don't do anything right the guys sitting on the roof suting themselves all day if you break up the company into three or four smaller companies right there's just way less room for people to the doj could also Force Google to make its advertising knowledge available to its Rivals but the most likely scenario is mandating that Google abandoned the deals with apple that made its search engine the default option and the same goes for the deal with Android manufacturers too law professor Spencer Weber Waller agrees quote there are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way more likely it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts exclusive contracts and Licensing restrictions that have reinforced its Monopoly position for years end quote now to the latest updates on September 6th 2024 in Washington a hearing was held by the doj the result of the hearing was that Google was going to be given an outline in December as to what they should do to restore competition in the market the prosecution hasn't finalized the details of the recommendation but justice department attorney David delist said that it should be sweeping the recommendations may include what we just covered but interestingly the doj is specifically looking at the intersection of artificial intelligence and Google's plans during the hearing there was lots of talk about Google's Gemini and what else Google had up their sleeve meanwhile Google said that they were concerned that the doj will hamstring their efforts in the next generation of search technology Google's Attorney John smed line said at the hearing that the company requires an in-depth proposal from the US government prosecutors he said that they need to know the details as soon as possible could also turn out that Google could reach out to Microsoft and open AI to come to their aid in regards to convincing the government that AI search isn't going to be dominated by Google after this around next August,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has ruled that Google operates illegally as a monopoly in the online search market, with Google controlling 90% of the market. The ruling, which describes Google's anti-competitive practices, includes paying to block competition and raising ad prices without consumer consequences. The DOJ is considering breaking up Google, possibly separating services like YouTube and Android, and dismantling exclusive contracts with Apple and other companies. Despite these legal challenges, Google has stated its intent to appeal and argues that its agreements with Apple are standard industry practice. The DOJ's actions may also impact Google's future in artificial intelligence and search technology, with the potential for significant changes in the company's structure and operations."
this video is brought to you by incog a northern California couple pleading guilty to a massive Ponzi scheme prosecutors say Jeff and pette kpof defrauded investors out of1 billion the stories of inventors are usually filled with inspiration and Ingenuity a story of humble and sometimes downright tragic circumstances that can turn around in the most majestic of ways at first glance this appears to be the story of Jeff kpof he was a 36-year-old jobless ex mechanic who lived in a rundown house with his wife and kids he was at Rock Bottom because all of his previous attempts to find Financial stability had failed but then out of desperation and sheer happen stance he invents a groundbreaking product or at least he thinks so anyway his invention gains incredible momentum and within a few short years he's transformed from being broke to a millionaire The Invention a mobile solar generator even without formal education investors poured Millions into his company even a US Bank and Warren Buffett's burky hathway got involved but beneath the surface it was all a scam in the end the scheme reached over $1 billion that's right billion with a be this is the story of Jeff kpo and how he orchestrated one of California's most significant frauds in its history you are watching T Fusion TV [Music] Jeff kof wouldn't be described as your typical Visionary he was an ordinary guy who enjoyed watching motor racing and baseball games his goals were simple make a decent living and provide a comfortable life for his family he grew up poor in the gritty town of Martinez California it was a bleak backdrop oil refineries billowed smoke and crime was rampant kpof would later describe the town as quote where the sewer meets the sea this description may have been a bit of a stretch but it captured the essence of the place from an early age Jeff learned to fend for himself and he dabbled in various odd jobs he floated around life on the edge of society brushes with addiction Petty crimes and Drug dealings were his early adult years his marriage to his high school girlfriend pette offered a glim of Hope together they started a successful Land Rover Repair shop this showcased Jeff's talent for fixing cars and attracting loyal customers however a disastrous business decision led to the Shop's closure in 2007 after that Financial desperation pushed him back to selling drugs again to make ends meet perhaps these early struggles set the stage for Jeff kof's Journey towards a fraudulent [Music] path Jeff now 36 years old had lost his business he had no money mounting debt and a mortgage to pay pedaling drugs forever was not a feasible option he needed a fresh start and he got one when he landed a job as a solar panel salesman he then realized something people were interested in solar but they were worried about their panels getting stolen and this gave him an idea what if he could make panels mobile and versatile he imagined hooking them up to a trailer that could be moved and parked anywhere having never gone to College Jeff kpof knew nothing about engineering ing but he was a skilled mechanic and he did like to Tinker with things so he drew up a plan on the back of a napkin and called in his car mechanic brother-in-law through trial and error they hacked together a Contraption with two rows of five solar panels mounted on a rotating beam the entire apparatus was constructed in a way that could be locked and tilted for easy transportation and sun exposure one could say that it was nothing special maybe even something a couple of Blockheads could have come up with but as fate would have it this tinker project would make history and well not in a good way meanwhile the portable generator Market was huge and growing it was worth nearly $3 billion a year the potential was massive although Jeff and his brother-in-law had no clue of this they didn't know how big the market was or even how to tap into it but as time wore on Jeff didn't think much of the initial idea at first however an old customer from back in his car shop days da Watson saw the potential Watson was a software consultant in the affluent Bay Area and he knew a thing or two about investment so he offered to help kpof and his wife start their company DC solar and it was to launch in 2008 by making solar mobile we've redefined energy independence with that we can provide solar light towers solar power electric vehicle charging stations the possibilities are endless at the same time Watson and his associates would handle marketing and this is where things really got cooking the initial plan of attack was to aim sales at Hollywood at the time movie sets were powered by noisy diesel generators portable solar panels could be a perfect quiet alternative the initial feedback was positive some big movies like Inception and Valentine's Day gave them a shot and the idea caught on even famous environmentalist actor Leonardo DiCaprio showcased the panels on his Facebook page it was the perfect organic promotion this was 2009 after all back then the public could basically lap up practically anything that a celebrity would [Music] endorse Jeff may not have been a Visionary but he understood the power of networking and he went all out from posing as a big shot entrepreneur to attending cocktail parties and even telling his Underdog personal story to win people over Jeff was just one of those guys who could talk his way into anything he would embellish stories and outright lie oh wow you saw saw shootings and stabbings growing up that's crazy that makes it even more amazing that you turned out to be such a brilliant entrepreneur but Jeff's mother would later tell the publication the Atlantic that Jeff always made stories up about his upbringing to make people feel sorry for him or just for a laugh his attempts paid off and he managed to make some important connections among top tier business professionals the most significant breakthrough came when kpof connected with a law firm called Nixon Peabody the firm was renowned for its expertise in getting special tax benefits for Industries including Renewable Power it was all falling into [Music] place the game-changing factor was that Congress tripled the value of investment tax credits in 2005 businesses could now get a whopping 30% of their federal income taxes back as a credit on any money they spent buying and installing solar equipment that means for every dollar spent they got 30 cents back from the government effectively an intrinsic 30% disc discount the DC solar trailers were a lucrative option for companies that just wanted to cut back on their tax bills and go green he set up a special fund that let buyers purchase the number of generators that align with the desired tax savings they only had to pay a 30% price UPF front and then take that exact amount off their taxes so basically they got their money back right away but what about the rest of the money DC solar promised to loan the remaining 70% to buyers the buyers would pay it back by leasing the generators on DC solar's behalf Jeff even guaranteed loan payments and offered cash payouts from the leasing Revenue it was an incredible deal for the companies on top of that they didn't have to worry about using maintaining or even laying eyes on their own generators as you're probably studying together these deals have very little to do with kof's product it was primarily based on exploiting the tax credit and the other perks that came with it that's why so many big companies fell for it the Allure of the benefits was so strong that parties often overlooked the necessity of comprehensive due diligence in all of this one crucial question was overlooked did the generator business model actually work well we'll soon find [Music] out it was March of 2011 and Jeff was attending a baseball game just as he was singing the National Anthem his phone buzzed with a text he had done it it was his first major deal the paint company Sherwin Williams Pur purchased 192 generators for $29 million he couldn't believe it the ball was really rolling now with this major deal Jeff's eyes were opened such a partnership could draw in more investors and not long after US Bank would join the party the bank believed that joining DC solar would align with its goals of promoting sustainability reducing tax and creating local jobs unfortunately for them they were unaware that Jeff had used fake documents and fraudulent transactions to inflate the demand for solar generators without verifying the facts the US Bank would become one of the First Financial backers for DC solar the plan was to purchase and Lease thousands of generators over the next 7 years despite the initial success questions began to appear about the real usefulness of Jeff's generators the lack of solar expertise was evident some movie sets began to experienced power outages due to faulty generators Jeff's brother-in-law Bobby Amo who was the builder of the Solar Generator products now called the solar eclipse would State quote I had no idea how solar worked good thing they had Google and all that end quote imagine using Google to build something that would net your company hundreds of millions of dollars the problems with the solar generators became so frequent that it wasn't uncommon for DC solar to use backup diesel generators to kick in after a power failure there would be smoke pouring from behind a solar generator the ultimate ironic imagery furthermore in preparation for the w L upcoming sale of equipment to Sheran Williams the paint company DC solar was to present their Fleet of panels a DC solar employee went to the production facility to see how things were going it wasn't good the clients were soon due to inspect the whole Fleet but only the first row of panels were complete the rest were just cobbled together to give the illusion that things were progressing faster than they actually were the employee pressed Jeff who remarked eh don't worry about it so was Jeff worried not really he was busy enjoying his new $1.3 million home paid in cash it had a pool and enough car space for six Vehicles a bigger problem was brewing however almost nobody wanted to lease these things for 5 to 10 years and without these long-term leases DC solar couldn't Finance the buyer's massive purchase loans or meet the demand for returns Additionally the IRS would prevent buyers from claiming solar tax credits if generators were left unused without those credits DC solar would lose its most appealing feature what on Earth was Jeff and his team going to do now faced with these challenges DC solar was financially toast but Jeff wasn't done yet he decided to get crafty a new idea emerged around June 2012 it was during a meeting between Jeff and two of his Close Associates at the company they devised a scheme to use the purchase money from new buyers to pay quote lease money to previous ones the trick was to manipulate accounting so that the companies cash from new generator sales appeared as lease payments from existing renters the whole plan seemed eerily like a classic Pony scheme but with an added layer DC solar didn't just defraud new buyers to pay off earlier ones it used the facade as a legitimate Solar Company to drain millions in tax credits from the US Treasury this meant that American taxpayers ended up subsidizing the fraud Jeff pitched it as a temporary measure just to make ends meet a typical fake it to you make it approach as we'll later see Jeff's lies began to spiral out of control and the disaster that was to follow was nothing short of [Music] Spectacular Now the problem for Jeff was he had to keep fooling more investors to keep the scheme going that's just the nature of a Ponzi scheme it relies on constantly bringing in money from new investors to pay off the old ones it's like building a house of cards with a small base and a very wide top so to maintain the illusion of success Jeff had to get get creative when prospective buyers inquired he'd say that his generators will lease to different customers the truth was he moved a few around to make it seem like there was demand he'd jack up their value and create fake lease agreements with madeup renters he even roped in a former IRS agent and a shell company to help close a $76 million deal now you might be wondering how did nobody catch on where were the authorities well the IRS did try to investigate in 2014 but DC solar's legal representative Forest milder took every step to suppress it at least for the time being some investors were getting suspicious at the time to mitigate the damage the team at DC solar had to become expert scammers remember barely anyone was leasing these things so there wasn't enough money coming in to make the payments to the old buyers the heat was being turned up and Jeff needed bigger clients Valley National Bank who was going to purchase $ 76.8 million of solar equipment asked for the list of companies renting out DC solar generators after all Jeff said over 80% of the generators were being rented out the truth was only 5% were and this was a problem in the end they deployed DC solar CFO Rob Carman a former alcoholic who couldn't hold a job and was only employed by the company because he was an old high school buddy of the accountant at DC solar robwood forg a bunch of documents and leasing figures to make the problem go away and the scam continued Fates would later catch DC solar but for now the coast was clear the participation of Geico which is a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's birkshire Hathaway added a massive layer of credibility the question is how did such an esteemed company get into the mix by Jeff lying to them of course Jeff wanted to play with the big players and to do that he needed to make his business seem even bigger so he CED up a fake lease deal agreement with the Telecom giant T-Mobile one of his henchmen got a T-Mobile employee on board by offering a huge salary and bonus all this employee had to do was sign some forged papers,"Jeff and Pette Kpof ran a massive Ponzi scheme through their company, DC Solar, defrauding investors of over $1 billion. Initially, Jeff, a former mechanic with no formal education, created a mobile solar generator, which gained traction after being marketed as a sustainable, tax-efficient investment. However, the products were often faulty, and the company relied on fraudulent transactions, inflated demand, and fake lease agreements to keep the scheme going. With the help of fabricated documents, Jeff attracted major investors, including US Bank, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, and T-Mobile, until the fraud was eventually uncovered."
"I have a business marketing degree but ended up with two retail jobs one that pays $10 an hour and the other with fewer shifts at $25 an hour I'm not making enough to get by I'm not going to have experienced this that most young adults do or did in the past because everything is just too expensive there's so much unknown I sometimes struggle to afford food despite working full-time and living with a roommate making ends meet means pulling money from savings skipping a meal or drinking water so that I can try and see full these individuals are from Generation z a generation who are coming of age right now a common reaction to the previous statements are as follows every generation has their own issues to deal with during their time and this new generation just simply needs to work harder while some could say that that's partially true it's clear that the numbers are not in favor of jenz when I first started Living on my own I was paying $280 a week in rent my landlord wanted to increase my rent now to $450 a week I make over three times the federal minimum wage and I cannot afford to live where does this go in 5 years when 100 million Americans cannot buy a home and get a fixed rate and their rents being raised 200 every year six in 10 genz ear feel unable to save for the future only 15% of gen Z expect to be able to afford a home in the next 5 years and 80% of those who rent worry that rental costs will keep Rising beyond their capacity to afford them 47% of gen Z report that they or a household member lost a job or took a pay cut due to the covid-19 pandemic and this makes them the most affected generation around 40% of gen Z are struggling with mental health with financial stress being a major factor so how did a generation that was poised for Success end up in such financial distress a gen Z really as lazy as many people claim or can we really blame this generation just think about it they had to live through multiple economic crises geopolitical tensions a global pandemic and a new constant fear of AI threatening to replace them and how do Millennials and Boomers play a part in all of this in this special episode we go through a journey of generations and we look at the real reasons why gen Z is facing the brunt of it all we'll tackle this topic in three broad categories housing the economy and education a quick note although this episode is focused on gen z a lot of this applies to younger Millennials too and a lot of these numbers are America focused but will definitely be including other countries around the world too so join us as we try to answer perhaps the most important question facing this generation is Gen Z truly the poorest generation in modern times you are watching cold fusion TV before we dive in let's paint a vivid picture of who we're talking about when we say genz at the time of writing the oldest of them would be around 27 years of age in America and Britain this group is 1/5 of the population a similar proportion to current Baby Boomers the developing world has more of them in Nigeria gen Z makes up 32% of the population and 27% for India in the west compared to Millennials gen Z are more environmentally conscious drink and smoke less and are in less relationships they care more about social issues although they socialize less 38 minutes per day versus an hour for the eth of the year 2000 you can watch my loneliness epidemic video for more on that side of things celebrities in this generation include the likes of Billy ish zanda Greta thunberg mbappe Mr Beast and Naomi Osaka while these genz celebrities are obviously doing fine everyday people in their cohort are coming of age into tough times what is really screwed up is the world is massively in debt the workforce is shrinking population's growth is slowing down it's slowing down GDP growth so there's not enough GDP growth to pay or service the amount of debt out there and what we found since 2008 that the answer to this debt issue has been printing of more money debasement of currency people think of it in terms of at first they think it's going to be inflation as in the price of CPI goes up but it's actually not it's actually something much worse is Wages don't rise but assets go up because optically you're debasing the currency but what's happening is you can't afford as much of that now and so your future self is in fact poorer so a classic example is a 35-year-old now in the United States getting married having kids a house is very expensive now compared to when Peter and I were young it was relative cheap three times incomes now it's like 10 times incomes so there's no real way of getting up the ladder so the advantages that your parents had are not available to you for Gen Z above all there's probably one thing that feels more Out Of Reach than anything else [Music] housing if you've scrolled through any social media feed you've likely come across memes like these this humor hits close to home for 34% of genz who see home ownership as an impossible feat in their lifetime not in the next 10 to 20 years but an entire lifetime think about that for a second additionally in 2022 the typical age for a first home buyer hit a record high 36 geners are staying at home longer to save on rent for example in the US young adults living at home have increased 87% over the last two decades and in Australia it's risen 177% just since 2016 in Sydney only 0.1% of the properties there are affordable for the average household for one student in Canada he found it cheaper to just fly to his classes to avoid higher rent I need to pay like 2500 for the rent I don't feel that is like you know viable the problem really becomes clear when you see the disparity visually in the US home prices are now Rising twice as fast as income now it takes about about 6 years of income to buy the average house for Boomers this was 2 to 3 years Generation X 3 to 4 years Millennials 4 to 5 years and as just shown gen Z 6 to 7 years but Australia is on another level the average house price in Sydney $1.6 million if you're on a single wage it takes 14 years of income on average to buy a house remember that's 14 years of work if you save 100% of everything you earn in other words you'd have to be homeless and eating out of garbage bins to do that just astonishing and then there's stories like this this three bedroom Padington home in Native renovation selling at auction for an ey watering $9 million that's a whole million and a half above the reserve boasting off street parking and a converted St the Terrace last sold in 1981 for $300,000 the new buyers are planning to spend anywhere from a million to 5 million to bring it up to scratch and this this split level one-bedroom apartment in Bondi Junction which is listed for $900 to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement among the applicants were two young Maids both male and wish to say Anonymous they were prepared to c-li in this one better these are the kind of sacrifices people are having to make there's a myriad of reasons of why this is happening in Australia and I'm going to do an entirely separate video on this topic alone but the bottom line is prices have surged more than 22% in just one year in the UK things are bad too the average house cost nine times as much as average earnings in the UK the last time house prices were this higher compared to earnings was almost 150 years ago back in 1876 but this is where things get a little more complicated there's actually a Twist here with Generation Z despite a global shortage in affordable housing and Rising property prices gen Z seems to be navigating the housing market adequately data from red fin over in the US shows that 30% of 25-year-olds owned homes in 2022 3% more than their Gen X counterparts at the same age well how is this here's what different experts say those in gen Z took advantage of record low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021 this made servicing a mortgage less of a burden gen Z has more remote work opportunities so they're able to live somewhere remote and more affordable and lastly this cohort has more access to technology information and platforms which all help in their home purchases according to Ben Miller the CEO of fundrise quote every generation is getting more economically screwed in some ways but they gen Z have way more knowledge and information than previous generations way way way more that's got to count for something end quote interestingly in comparison Millennials aren't doing so great with housing it seems like the 08 crisis hit that cohort hard when it came to buying a house on a societal level the problem of home ownership is making it harder for both younger Millennials and gen Z to think about marriage and having kids a solution that's equally as sad as it is dystopian is the tiny home Trend Jen zers and Millennials are buying pre-fabricated tiny homes on Amazon for under $40,000 as the median price of American homes tops $400,000 here in California the median house is over $770,000 a silver lining here is that reports suggest that the job market is booming or is it if you're 15 to 24 years old in some places you'd be lucky to have a job in Spain the unemployment rate of this age bracket is 28% Sri Lanka 27% Greece 25% Italy and Sweden 23% in China things also aren't going great for the young thanks to economic uncertainty and a large population in higher education over one-third of degree holders there may be unemployed let's go back to other parts of the world in the west the picture looks a lot better but as you'll soon see not all is as it seems youth unemployment across the Richer countries of the world on average is around 13% It hasn't been this low since 1991 but you might be thinking something doesn't feel right about this Rosy picture it's not like here jenzy and Millennials rejoicing about how good the job market is so what is going on why don't the figures line up with what everyone's feeling well the fact is the figures we often hear aren't telling us the full story for example in 1994 in the US the government changed the way they count unemployment they stopped counting all of those who stopped looking for work or only have part-time employment a lot of other countries have done this too and when you factor that in everything starts to make sense Peter Schiff explains further so if you're really want to put today's unemployment in context what you have to compare is the current U6 number to the u3 number that existed prior to 1994 and I happened to do that and what I found if you look at the 1950s and 1960s there wasn't a single year during those two decades where unemployment was as high as it is right now you got to go to the 1970s that was 1975 oh in 1976 so only 2 years and that's supposed to be a horrible decade stagflation Jimmy Carter all the bad stuff that happened there were only 3 years during the 1980s when unemployment was higher than it is right now we were in the worst recession since the Great Depression the FED had interest rates up at 20% right we were really trying to fight inflation so only during the latter 1970s and early 1980s did you have unemployment higher than it is right now so how is Gen Z doing today overall opinions are divided on the one hand Lawrence kotlov an economics professor at Boston University agrees that quote this is a tougher climate for sure parents need to realize that their kids are in trouble end quote others like personal finance expert Ken Coleman believe that gen Z has an advantage due to technology which levels the playing field quote I think this next Generation this gen Z generation and the kids coming up behind them I think we're going to see an entrepreneurial boom like we've never seen in history because of the playing field being leveled by technology making it so much easier end quote while it's true that technology does indeed help even the playing field will it be enough and it could be a double-edged sword for example AI advancements however hyped and overblown today in some areas could provide a real challenge to working humans over the next decade we'll have to wait and see okay so that was the job market but once genas get a job how are they doing well again again there's some interesting stuff going on gen Z have figured out something pretty smart changing jobs more often allows them to earn more almost 30% more according to Business Insider according to the economist the wages for Gen Z are rising much faster than other age groups in America hourly pay rates for those 16 to 24 were 7% higher year on-ear compared with workers aged 25 to 54 at 13% in Britain the pay of those age 18 to 21 Rose 15% last year and this is far greater than the other age groups in New Zealand the average hourly pay of those age 20 to 24 increased by 10% compared to the average of 6% in a few places including Croatia and Slovenia genz are already earning as much as the average worker it's all very interesting the explanation for this could be simple after the postco inflation started exploding a lot of people would ask for a raise and they got it but the difference would is this they're the youngest cohort so they had the lowest base wage because their wage was lower companies could afford to pay them more as it was still cheaper than retraining someone else for example so when you look at the proportions genz seems to be","Generation Z faces significant financial challenges, including high rent, housing unaffordability, and job insecurity, with many struggling to make ends meet despite working full-time. This generation is dealing with rising costs, especially in housing, where home prices are increasingly out of reach, and many are delaying milestones like homeownership, marriage, and having children. Although some Gen Z individuals benefit from more job opportunities and the ability to leverage technology, the economic climate remains tough, with rising unemployment rates and inflation. While Gen Z’s wages are growing faster than older generations, their future remains uncertain due to economic instability, mental health struggles, and concerns about automation and AI."
"this video is brought to you by brilliant hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion when was the last time you used a CD or went to a physical music store remember flipping through the rows of shiny discs finding your favorite album or discovering something new unwrapping a new CD popping it into your player and hearing that crisp clean sound for the first time was a unique experience but when you think about it compact discs were actually pretty cool a laser scanning a spinning disc to read stored information delivering perfect quality music or files for something conceived in the 1970s compact discs were pretty futuristic of course with flash storage and now streaming and cloud storage those colorful discs are now the dinosaurs of Technology but what if I told you that CDs could still be the future incredibly researchers have made a breakthrough they've developed a 3D optical disc with a staggering 1.6 pits of storage capacity that's over 200,000 DV d s on a single disc so today we'll explore this incredible research and the unlikely Return of the compact disc how does it work will this ever see the light of day it is exciting but towards the end of the episode I'll get to the drawbacks as always but before all of that we'll take a fun trip down memory lane and delve briefly into the history of CDs it's quite an interesting story so let's jump into [Music] it you are watching C Fusion TV [Music] the CD's Journey began in the late 1970s when Phillips was working on video disc technology this was inspired by the emerging technology of lasers that could read data without contact research on video discs started all the way back in 1957 but it wasn't until the late '70s where Laser Technology became practical although it was ahead of its time the video disc project failed as the public ultimately weren't that interested I've done a full episode on laser discs if you're interested in that story but it wasn't the end Phillips saw an opportunity for using laser reading technology in the audio Market final records and tapes dominated at the time but they both had their limitations vinyl require delicate turntables prone to skipping while cassettes though portable and re-recordable lacked the character of vinyl audio and tended to degrade with repeated use Phillips aimed to create a smaller more portable disc that could hold at least an eror of music after years of research they developed audio longplay or Alp an audio disc system interestingly they initially considered quadrophonic sound an early form of surround sound but abandoned it due to size limitations the name compact disc was chosen to evoke the success of the compact cassette in March 1979 Phillips showcased the CD's audio quality however they lacked expertise in digital audio recording a crucial missing piece engineers at Phillips didn't know how to convert heard analog sound into digital that have to turn to Japan to solve that problem in Japan Sony was a master of digital audio circuitry with over a decade of experience refining the encoding of sound waves into digital signals however they lacked the expertise to create a physical compact disc this is where Phillips and Sony converged the result was genius Philips Engineers figured out how the laser could zoom past time etched pits etched into the disc surface and turned that into ones and zeros while Sony Specialists focused on the analog to digital circuitry also creating an error correcting code to maintain that pristine audio I remember reading about this in an encyclopedia when I was about 12 and I was amazed at how it worked anyway in 1980 Phillips and Sony produced The Red Book establishing all the standards for compact discs from then on they work separately on their own C equipment but agreed to share components in the early stages in April of 1982 Phillips introduced the first ever production CD player the initial CDs were made in a plant in Hanover Germany debut titles included Abba's album The Visitors and a recording of Herbert von karajan conducting Richard strauss's the Alpine Symphony in October of 1982 Sony CDP 101 made its debut in Japan Jaan alongside the first run of CD albums led by Billy Joel's 52nd Street Sony's device was pricey around $2,300 in today's currency initially us record labels were skeptical about CDs but one year later 1,000 different titles were available in time the audio quality began to speak for itself in 1985 di Strait's album brothers and arms became the first CD to sell over a million copies and it Remains the world's most successful CD album by 1988 400 million CDs were produced by 50 pressing plants worldwide in the year 2000 Global CD sales peaked at 2.45 billion between 2000 and 2007 CD sales nearly halfed to 1.75 five billion and this was mainly due to file sharing and MP3 players and we all know the story from here ultimately the rise of streaming services and changing consumer preferences led to the decline of CDs by 2021 CD sales had dropped by 95% since their Peak currently at their lowest levels since 1986 major artists like Adele Taylor Swift and BTS caused a brief Resurgence of CD sales in 2021 but the overall trend remains very downward and the fall of music CDs took CD ROMs and other forms of optical media with it so it's pretty much done that's it it's certain CDs once dominated but now they just occupy a nostalgic corner or do they well as mentioned at the top of this episode the life of the CD may not be over so I was thrilled to see this recent paper in nature about a new optical storage method that could bring dis memory into the petabyte range petabytes that's 1,000 terabytes imagine having to store around 6 billion web pages so if you store this massive amount of data on 1 terabyte hard drive the device will cover the area about the size of an average playground but with this new technology the same amount of data can be stored in the device the size of a desktop computer researchers at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology have developed a 3D optical disc with an astonishing capacity it can store up to 1.6 petabytes of data they published their study in nature and it's understandably caused a bit of a buzz so 1.6 pbits what is that that amount of data on a single optical disc is amazing but without context it's just a number so let's break it down let's compare it to the current champion of storage the exod drive Eed ct100 is currently the largest solid state drive available it offers a staggering 100 tab of storage capacity but the price well it's jaw-dropping $40,000 or $400 per terabyte and you thought Apple was bad but the thing is to put that into perspective a 100 terab is enough space for approximately 20 million songs 20,000 HD movies or 2,000 standard iPhones worth of data well that is a lot well this disc has even more capacity 1.6 pedits is equivalent to 200 terab or 200,000 GB the craziest thing is this new disc is about the same size as as a normal DVD but holds 4,000 times as much as a Blu-ray okay so you must be asking how did the researchers do it here's a simplified and brief explanation of it the secret behind this massive storage lies in layers traditional Optical discs like CDs or DVDs typically have one or two layers to store data sometimes they can go up to four but this new disc is like a skyscraper with 100 Floors each layer holding precious information by stacking these layers the researchers have crammed in more data than ever before next ultr transparent materials and nanoscale spots to achieve this feat they used Advanced Materials that allows light to pass through with minimal scattering now imagine tiny spots microscopic dots on each layer these spots are where the magic happens researchers created a new material called aggregation induced emission di doped photoresist or a i e ddpr for short it's a fancy and quite a mouthful of a term but think of these spots as data pixels the interesting thing here is that they're smaller than the wavelengths of visible light this was a limitation of traditional optical storage but now with this method they can record data in sections as small as 1/10th the wavelength of visible light this allows for the encoding of data on those 100 layers it's like writing with a super fine pen on an atomic scale so how do you write data onto this disc well it's like orchestrating a laser ballet a green laser triggers spot formation it's like a conductor raising the battern then a red laser steps in and switches off the writing process by controlling the timing they made the spots smaller than the waves of light themselves it's akin to Precision Machining with light on a nanoc scale to read the data they employed another laser Duo a blue beam makes the spots glow then an orange light turns off the glove and with that the data is revealed according to the researchers their disk with 100 layers spaced just a micrometer apart can read and write data very accurately to give you some imagery of the accuracy here's a demonstration of some layers being written on and remember the scale is 5 micromet but the journey to get here has been long and arduous Professor mingu who led the research explains how challenging it was over the last 10 years to find the perfect materials that could both handle reading and writing data in such a small space the plus side is manufacturing a disc is also easy it takes about 6 minutes per disc and it uses a similar method for those used in [Music] DVDs these new Ultra high-capacity discs are well suited for data centers these diss could enable data centers to store exabytes of data in a much smaller physical space than current Technologies think a billion gbits of storage in a room instead of a stadium also Optical discs are known for their longevity and durability so this makes them ideal for long-term archival storage they're portable and also robust against electromagnetic interference so this makes it suitable for safeguarding critical data but of course now the moment you've all been waiting for the downsides and limitations while the new Optical discs hold a lot of promise there are some severe limitations and challenges to consider so obviously there's market adoption apart from niche market segments like data storage and archival storage using physical media will be a tough sell everyone's already used to cloud storage and streaming services they're not going to want to give up their convenience physical media is just an extra step and added friction and next we come to one of the biggest issues current prototypes have major limitations in terms of writing speed and efficiency the estimated energy consumption would be in the kilowatt range per terabyte of writing and the right speed is only megabytes per second researchers are working on improving these aspects but who knows how long that's going to take and next next we have the cost a fosc laser similar to one of the ones used in the setup costs almost $50,000 and needs fans from an AC outlet now that is a showstopper if I've ever seen one lasers etching data on a nano scale really is amazing isn't it science as a whole is amazing but it can be overwhelming to understand well fortunately there's a fun and easy way to learn about it with brilliant.org brilliant

so in conclusion it seems like CDs wouldn't be making a comeback for the average consumer anytime soon but with such large amounts of storage in such a small medium there could be new uses for this technology perhaps data Sensers of the future we'll be using pedit CDs But ultimately realistically in the grand scheme of things research is research and for those of us interested in The Cutting Edge it's very cool to gwk over such Solutions but the reality is this will take many years to become a product if ever but I could be wrong and maybe the researchers will continue to refine the technology until it becomes commercially viable and the market responds positively but anyway what are your thoughts on this would you like to use such a beeroth of an optical disc format let me know in the comment section below so that is the story of the compact disc and its surprising possible fature okay so my name is toogo and you've been watching cold fusion and I'll catch you again soon for the next episode if you did like this video feel free to subscribe to Cold Fusion all right cheers guys have a good one [Music] [Music] cold fusion it's new thinking","Compact discs (CDs), once groundbreaking for their ability to store music digitally, have largely been replaced by streaming and cloud storage. However, recent advancements in optical storage technology have led to the development of a 3D optical disc with an extraordinary 1.6 petabytes of storage, significantly more than current storage devices. Researchers at the University of Shanghai have utilized advanced materials and nanoscale engineering to create these high-capacity discs, which offer immense potential for data centers and long-term archival storage. Despite these advancements, challenges such as slow writing speeds, high energy consumption, and market adoption issues suggest that widespread consumer use of this technology may be far off."
"this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion as reported by CNBC out of all the countries on Earth Vietnam will see the sharpest increase in wealth over the next decade why well it's because in the background they've been positioning themselves to become the new Global manufacturing Hub after China many companies are ramping up manufacturing efforts in Vietnam including Apple Samsung and Intel so what you might be thinking having the projected fastest growth in the next decade might be a nice achievement but what's the big deal well what makes this success story so incredible is that just in a single generation Vietnam went from one of the poorest nations in the world to a middle- inome economy to really understand how radical Vietnam's rise is you must comprehend its history the Perpetual struggle of war and how it all turned around for them in this episode we explore the emerging Dark Horse on the economic Global stage Vietnam we'll see their struggles and how this massive transformation took place and we'll also see the challenges that it yet has to overcome you are watching cold fusion [Music] TV so what comes to mind when you think about Vietnam for many younger people it might be a budget friendly Southeast Asian Gateway with stunning Landscapes but for those a bit older it might evoke images of a poor country with dense jungles soldiers trudging through thick foliage ravaged Villages and scenes of fleeing refugees a land of hardship and strife this imagery was largely influenced by mainstream Western media it was all over the news but also films like platoon and Full Metal Jacket portrayed the brutality of the Vietnam War but now in the mid 2020s this is simply a distant memory today the Lively streets of hoochi Min City Vietnam's largest Metropolis are filled with the buzz of motorbikes and aroma of street food and an energy of a Nation on the rise in the country's capital Hanoi skyscrapers Stand Tall high-tech industrial parks Buzz with activity and luxury Brands line the streets the city's Lively atmosphere can be felt there's young professionals everywhere and they're leading the charge creating everything from startups to sustainable agriculture the Boost in Economic Development has contributed to a significant rise in living standards but in Vietnam there's a saying Gua low guwan which in English Loosely translates to in hardship wisdom emerges and this couldn't be more fitting for the story we're about to tell Vietnam was under French colonial rule for nearly a century starting in the mid 19th century Vietnam became part of French Indochina Federation of French Colonial territories in Southeast Asia including Laos and Cambodia under French rule the country's resources were exploited for the benefit of the colonial power Vietnamese people faced har treatment forc labor and heavy taxation after nearly a century of Oppression resentment was quietly growing there was a strong desire for Independence among the Vietnamese people the desire had given rise to a revolutionary movement and it was led by hoochi Min he spent years abroad studying and rallying international support for Vietnam's cause he was an interesting character standing at 5'5 he wasn't physically intimidating and strangely he actually respected the Dem values of France but he thought that the French practicing colonialism was hypocritical although hii Min stated that he didn't like violence if anyone got in his way he would crush them later revered as the founding father of modern Vietnam hoi Min became the leader of the vietman a communist-led resistance group dedicated to ending colonial rule the Vietnamese were finally going to fight back there was an attempt for a peaceful resolution with the French but after peace talks broke down the struggle for Independence culminated in war in 1946 it was a war between hoi men's resistance Army and French forces the brutal conflict dragged on for nearly a decade France's control over Vietnam was heavily weakened after the second world war in 1954 the French were finally forced to negotiate the agreement was to split Vietnam in half the North and the South and this division would set the stage for the country's next chapter in history so now Vietnam was no longer under French rule but the road to reunification was far from smooth the peace was fragile and tensions between the Communist North led by hoochi Min and the anti-communist South quickly escalated the United States fearing a spread of Communism in Southeast Asia began to support the South Vietnamese government but the USA's full involvement only made matters worse these are US soldiers fighting on Vietnam's front lines they are giving their lives they are not just giving their advice to a degree Never foreseen by Kennedy we hold the destiny of Vietnam in our hands and it holds ours in essence the war was as much a battle of ideologies as it was a struggle for control from 1955 to 1975 Vietnam was engulfed in a brutal war that brought unimaginable suffering and destruction the American intervention marked by extensive bombing campaigns ground operations and millions of soldiers and total made headlines around the world the Youth of America protested against the war causing a social divide locally between Generations the war in Vietnam is no longer simply their War to win or lose it's ours as well and it has become the most divisive in a 100 Years of American History do the results match the effort student protests in 1970 at Kent State University saw a brutal Crackdown from the US National Guard resulting in the deaths of four students students the event shocked the world and this incident culturally later became known as the official end of the peace era of 1960s America the war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon the capital of South Vietnam after the fall Saigon was renamed hoi Min City in honor of the North Vietnamese leader finally the country was reunified under a socialist republic however the newly formed Vietnam faced a severe hardship the economy was en rued infrastructure was destroyed and agriculture crippled more than anything the war left an irreparable scar on the Vietnamese people Millions died Villages were burnt to the ground and families were torn apart the land was scarred by chemical defoliators the effects of which are still felt today the devastation of this war is well documented but I just want to give you an estimation on the level of Destruction about 1 to 3 million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians 300,000 cambodians 20,000 to 60,000 Lans and 58,000 US service members died in the conflict around 4.6 million tons of bombs were dropped on Vietnam it caused extensive damage to the countryside and infrastructure over the span of two decades a total of 3 million people from Laos Cambodia and Vietnam fled their countries according to the unhcr 800,000 of these refugees were Vietnamese who escaped by boat later to become known as the boat people of Vietnam so to recap Vietnam endured nearly a century under French colonial rule facing harsh treatment and exploitation hoi Min led the Revolutionary movement for Vietnamese Independence culminating in the first Indochina War a war with his resistance Army against the French in 1954 Vietnam achieved independence from French colonial rule the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975 involved a significant us participation the conflict ended with the reunification of the country under a socialist [Music] regime so after Decades of fighting and destruction Vietnam was left in ruins it was one of the poorest nations of the world the GDP per capita was hovering between $150 and $300 in the late 1980s to 1995 to give you an idea today in GDP per capita terms that would make it the second poorest country on on Earth ahead of Bundi and just below Afghanistan back then in Vietnam the struggle to rebuild was immense the path to recovery seemed daunting under a strict socialist system many refugees did return to their country and the streets of Hanoi and hoi Min City started to bustle with activity again yet the air was thick with the weight of economic despair the people in power knew that something needed to be done in December of 1986 the government introduced a policy called doy Moy the doy Mo reforms meaning renovation or innovation were born out of necessity and a desire for Renewal the initiative led by prime minister Nan Kong hon aimed to transition Vietnam from a command economy to a socialist oriented market economy the initial steps were cautious but significant everything was State controlled so in that context here are some key points and Milestones this reform achieved over time in the north leaders of Agriculture cooperatives who were respons ible for managing Collective farming efforts were now allowed to rent out land to individual Farmers this marked a shift away from strict government control Farmers gained more control over their plots allowing them to manage their own production and keep any surplus beyond their quotas this change revitalized agricultural output and boosted the rural economy provincial governments were given the freedom to create their own trading companies breaking the state's tight grip on foreign trade private markets for agricultural products emerged and price controls over consumer goods were lifted this allowed trade to flourish at market-driven prices the reforms extend far beyond agriculture the 1987 foreign investment law took manufacturing facilities out of the hands of the state and allowed foreign investors to establish businesses own property and make a profit at the same time domestic private Enterprises were encouraged to be established this led to a surge in domestic companies however the full potential potential of these reforms was initially hampered by a us trade embargo which had been in place since 1975 seemingly a Remnant from the Vietnam War but when the United States finally lifted the Embargo in 1994 the landscape of Vietnam's economy began to change [Music] dramatically among the first to recognize Vietnam's potential were Global Giants Nike and Adidas Nike set up a factory in Vietnam just one year after the Embargo lifted Adidas was soon to follow these companies saw an opportunity Vietnam had a favorable investment climate and a cheap labor force something which isn't always good and we'll get to that in a sec but right now Nike works with over 100 suppliers in Vietnam starting in the early 2000s Adidas began establishing multiple factories across Vietnam by 2021 Vietnam had become the country's largest sourcing country contributing to roughly 40% of its total Footwear production in 2021 Vietnam exported foot Ware to over 100 countries with production climbing to around 17.8 billion us today many Brands such as Zara and H&M have factories in Vietnam and there's $455 billion of total registered capital in the form of direct foreign investments into Vietnam there's almost 40,000 of these foreign investment companies and within those companies over 1,300 of them are fashion brands when factories open new jobs are created for the local Vietnam people in 20111 21% of employees were working in the industry and Manufacturing sector today this is over 33% there's also opportunities for high- skilled jobs such as managerial positions though of course it's not all sunshine and rainbows though sadly there are companies that use exploitative practices and diminish the rights of the workers but despite that in aggregate there has been upward Mobility for those in Vietnam between 1993 and 2014 Vietnam raised around 40 million people out of poverty during this period the poverty rate plummeted from nearly 60% to 14% but there's still much more to be done and we'll touch on that later today Vietnam's economy is growing up 5.8% while the global average is 2.9% so what's going on here well in Vietnam it's mix of smart trade policies Savvy domestic reforms and Hefty investments in infrastructure and human capital analysts from the World Bank and Brookings Institute suggest that there are three key factors driving Vietnam's continued economic growth let's take a closer look at these points number one trade agreements and liberalization Vietnam has strategically opened its Market through key trade agreements joining the Asian free trade area in 1995 a deal with the US in 2000 and joining the WTO in 20 2007 are notable examples since then Vietnam has secured trade agreements with China India Japan and Korea a 2018 trade deal with other countries like Australia New Zealand Malaysia Singapore Canada and Mexico and another trade deal with the EU in 2020 now joined the list these deals Poise Vietnam to be a future export Powerhouse number two domestic reforms Vietnam has complemented its external openness with some crucial domestic reforms these include deregulation and an effort to reduce the cost of doing business red tape and hassle are being minimized as a result in 2023 alone Vietnam attracted nearly $ 36.6 billion in foreign direct investment okay so what does that mean well it's extremely significant because that's a 32.1% increase from just the previous year it's an absolute rocket ship but in saying that there's also the point of appearing tough on corruption it's a point which we talked about with the case of trong Myan after bribing everyone and stealing 3% of the nation's GDP she was sentenced to death it's a signal that Vietnam is getting serious even if it is just on the surface okay number three investing in capital with a population of 35 million half of whom are under 35 Vietnam has prioritized Public Funding for primary education and infrastructure it seems like they know the value of an educated and young Workforce Vietnam has always been an export heavy country its economy was once rooted in agriculture they had exports like wet rice coffee and black pepper but from 2008 to 2018 agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined as the industrial sector took off today it might surprise a lot of people but Vietnam stands out as a major player in the technology Hardware space in 2023 they exported 57.3 billion dollars worth of electronic devices computers and parts globally the country now ranks seventh in electronics exports this highlights a rapid change there's a growing presence of Global Tech companies such as Samsung Apple Intel and foxcon in Vietnam in fact such companies are flocking to the country eager to invest in and capitalize on its booming Market let's take a look at a few examples Samsung the company produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam they're planning to boost investment from 18 billion to 20 billion in the near future since 2019 Apple's total Investments have exceeded 16 billion creating over 200,000 jobs in Vietnam and Tim Cook is investing heavily in Vietnam analysts forecast that by 20125","Vietnam, once one of the poorest countries in the world, has undergone a remarkable transformation, shifting from a war-torn nation to a rapidly growing economy. This growth is largely due to a combination of key reforms, strategic trade agreements, and significant foreign investments. Following the devastation of the Vietnam War, the country adopted the Đổi Mới reforms in the 1980s, transitioning from a command economy to a socialist market economy. Over the past few decades, foreign companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple have invested heavily in manufacturing, creating millions of jobs and reducing poverty. Today, Vietnam is becoming a major player in global manufacturing and technology, with exports in electronics growing rapidly and its economy expanding at an impressive rate. However, challenges remain, including corruption and the need for continued development in education and infrastructure."
"we can say what we want about the F35 but the Martin Becker MK16 seat works extremely well and for the 11th loss of an F35 it once again saved its pilot even if the plane it must be said is apparently not go far these images are absolutely incredible and inevitably they make you think a little bit so I reassure you right away even if at the moment we cannot know precisely what happened and we do not have the knowledge the Americans are going to make investigations and one of these investigations the one led by the jag you perhaps remember from the series on TV will allow us within 1 year or 2 years to see a little more clearly on who is responsible for the loss of this plane worth several tens of millions of dollars why am I specifying this legal part because the safety investigation the feedback from operational experience the lon Len as the Americans say will probably never be published in open source and that is a shame, that’s why I’m still offering you to try to understand what could have brought this F35 into this situation given the information we have on this Wednesday January 29 at 12:51 p.m. go jingle [Music] on Tuesday January 28 around 1 p.m. local time an F35a crashed had declared a breakdown and he was returning to the field we do not know the precise nature of the breakdown all this took place in Alaska on the side of the large base of Elson Air Force Base which was manufactured in 1943 which was initially called m 26 satellite field because located 26 miles 42 km southeast of Fairbanks and which was renamed in 1948 with this name in homage to a pilot of the Great North American small point namely this base houses the 354th Fighter Wing they belong to the Pacific Air Force and it is there that the famous Red Flag Alaska exercises are organized which generally take place four times a year for around ten days. F16s you have F35as and you also have C135s the tankers this base was in decline and it was saved if I may say by the F35s they received their first in 2020 and now you have more than fifty F35s with approximately 3,500 personnel on this base an increase of more than 50% for personnel with the arrival of the F35 this base also participates in the protection of the airspace of North America the famous Norade and that is why there are also tankur to give the necessary extension because I remind you between Alaska and Russia there are only a few tens of kilometers in the radio exchanges that have been published online you hear wide 27 who is a tanker who is told to standby at 6000 feet because the broncho patrol at IFI IFE iNight Emer if they have a breakdown and will not let you don't be surprised that these conversations leak onto the Internet because they take place on UHF frequencies and many fans listen to all this live, it's legal and when clarmé doesn't want it to be heard he goes on secure frequencies we have for example a half quick system which does frequency evasion where you can have crypto or even communicate for example with link 16 you can talk to each other via what is called gvoice link 16 allows you to communicate between planes there we are on classic UHF these planes are also equipped with VHF for the record the Lig planes speak VHF the military rather in UHF so before going into the detail of the analysis of the images what I am offering you is an extremely refreshing quick on the F35 three small medium version technical memo so you don't get lost ABC AC airfield or aerodrome it's the Air Force version the one that was lost today B it's boat a boat a aircraft takeoff carrier vertical landing which is used for example by the marines and the third the C is like a carrier aircraft carrier catapult stopping strand A BC an airfield B boat vertical and C carrier with the Cross and enough to be catapulted by the catapult more of 1000 F35s of all different versions built first flight in 2006 but really operational for version a in the R force from 2016 and we are on a big baby 13 tons with almost 32 tons in mass a Rafale is 24 ton5 big specificity of the F35 its stealth and recently in the French press it was mentioned that the burst pilots of the The Air Force had difficulty facing stealth aircraft necessarily at long distance if you do not detect your adversary it is complicated however what is certain is that in close combat the F35 is not made for that the whole difficulty is managing to survive until the close combat we are going to come back a little bit on the accidentology of the F35s and to be precise of the ones in 2014 there was one who had taken fire on the ground at the Glin base in Florida due to a problem with the reactor they had stopped the fleet for around ten days and subsequently had made modifications to the F35 reactor in 2019 in April 2019 it is a Japanese pilot who announces the end of the fight because he is not well and who finds himself in a sensory illusion this is the official reason and hits the sea without trying to eject the air force unfortunately lost a pilot in the same conditions with the arrival of the Rafal at night in October 2019 it's funny to celebrate the arrival in the Netherlands of an F35 the firefighters welcomed it with cannons foam and it has grounded from the plane for 3 months in May 2020 still in Eglin normal there are many there a pilot who had his helmet which was incorrectly adjusted helmet where you have all the flight information ends up with fatigue and a flight control problem having to eject because he can no longer control his plane during landing we talked about it on the channel and in 2022 it is in South Korea an F35 after hearing a strange noise during THE flight only finds itself able to control the plane and the reactor and is forced to land with its gear retracted on the runway in Korea to finish we also spoke on the channel an F35 had a kill on another F35 in October 2022 in because of its wake turbulence the pilots had not respected the regulations on spacing and an F35 found itself in the wake turbulence losing control and had not been able to catch up the plane had been forced to eject that it's for the f35a so if we look a little bit at the philosophy we tend to see that there is still a little bit of human factor but that otherwise it's more problems that come from the machine and still it must be said about on-board computing if you are on an old generation aircraft and speak you put the stick to the left in Super Étendard the super éendard will go to the left you have a direct connection these 5th generation aircraft but even generation 4.5 you give an instruction is an electrical signal which goes into the computer, the aatic computer which looks at all these sensors and which will decide, given the macro situation, how they will move the flight controls to put it simply without computers you do not control the plane with a big computer problem you cannot go live to a 737 you can go live to Cesna you are live to an airplane like the F35 computer problem equals big problem and there what we knows it's that the plane is returning due to a breakdown what we also see in the images look at ha on the left is that he is accompanied there is another fighter probably F35 which accompanies him the fighters rarely leave alone in flight it's a training mission there were two of them and they were on the return what we also see is that the gear was out so when you come back broken down generally what you do you are with two planes depending on the nature of the breakdown there he had the weather looks good either the wounded bird the injured plane is in the lead and the other plane accompanies it and monitors it or the weather is not nice and you have problems on board the plane which is healthy is in the lead and you try to follow it in the clouds until you manage to acquire a view of the runway in general when you are the injured plane if the weather is good you prefer to have the liad and to be accompanied rather than having to manage your plane which has a problem to maintain anti-collision in relation to your leader so in a case like that it is likely to think that the plane which has the problem was in head accompanied by his colleague about a hundred meters away who ensures that the parameters are good and can even in which a slightly electronic plane like that remind him of the parameters we are at 1500 feet 200 knot we are at 1300 feet 190 knots we are at 1000 feet 180 knots take out your gear and so on and accompany it like that until the landing while reducing its workload by managing, for example, communications with the control tower, this allows you as plane broken down to focus on managing your machine because you are alone to manage everything and well that still takes a little bit of bandwidth and sometimes you have to take out a little checklist now what we see it's very interesting is that the pilot is under canopy and his plane is higher than him we agree it's not trivial what this can make you think it can make you think of a phase where the plane is no longer controllable as it begins to go upwards the pilot decides to exit finds himself ejected under canopy and there after the plane continues to climb loses its speed and descends it is a possibility now look at this distance between the trajectory of the parachute and the plane it’s still necessary to say it is not banal the other possibility would be that a plane is about to fall and you get out but in this case you are above the wreckage so clearly it is that the plane after ejection is mounted what we have already seen in the history of fighter aviation is that following the ejection this creates torques at the level of the plane and this changes its trajectory you are in horizontal volrecting you eject yourself it creates a couple the plane changes trajectory perhaps goes up and comes down unlikely but why not we know that on F35B we had the case of a plane which flew 10 minutes after the ejection of its pilot in horizontal flight we talked about it on the channel also small point of detail you see the pilot under his parachute you see that he has nothing underneath him so normally when you eject if you have time you check that your canopy will unclip you your snout you check that everything is going well you are not injured and then you come and remove your survival pact which is often hung under your buttocks why do you do that because it weighs you down and because when you fly for example above the water you have a dingy you have a canoe you have survival gear and if you release it it hangs about 6 m below you and when you reach the ground it hits the ground so it actually reduces the mass that you have and it will reduce your C drop a little bit there we can still see that under sail well it hits hard especially on frozen ground so the pilot is fine he is in stable condition the Americans reacted in a very professional manner compared to in this accident they were very transparent they explained what he had to explain they said the pilot ejected at the end of a training flight on the perimeter of the base they ask people not to stop to not take photos because it is forbidden to take photos on the base and there that brings us another lesson each time there is an F35 crash we will be precise 80% of the times where there is an F35 crash we have the images that come out and there these images come to us directly from the base they have an operational security problem the Americans like many other nations have this cultural problem that we see something we film we put it on the networks this is not normally compatible with the ethics and regulations on its military bases so it is more than likely that the person filming risks being pursued by the Americans because even if it's nice it gives us something to debrief from what to analyze what to share around the air trying to learn from it well it's not supposed to happen like that why do I insist on it because in each event we see each time that it is become a reflex among people I film I put on the internet there was the same case during the crash of the F35B on the British aircraft carrier the images were released while it was on an aircraft carrier and in the case of the loss of the F35C on the carries the American aircraft carrier the same it did not have to leave the aircraft carrier and very interesting to realize that in fact this type of accident did not necessarily exist in older generation aircraft where you could almost whatever happens maintain control of your plane even when there is no engine so these new planes have Achile heels when everything is working well they are extremely efficient planes when you start to have certain computer problems certain certain types of problems which come and press on your achiles heel we have what we call in the navy the cliff effect a huge loss of operational efficiency which can lead the pilot to eject fortunately the ejector works well Martin Becker has already shared the fact that he had just saved another F35 pilot now do not rush to criticize the F35 it is an aircraft which has proven itself in combat which has proven itself in RR which has its field of employment and its doctrine of employment and","On January 28, 2025, an F-35A experienced a breakdown while returning to its base in Alaska, leading to a crash after the pilot ejected. The aircraft, which was part of the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson Air Force Base, had declared a breakdown and was accompanied by another F-35 during the return. The incident, part of a training mission, highlighted potential issues with the aircraft's complex computing systems and the risks associated with ejection. Despite previous F-35 incidents, the plane’s seat design performed well, saving the pilot's life. The investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, but the event underscored the challenges faced by modern aircraft in combat and operational settings, with a significant focus on the increasing reliance on computerized systems."

I still remember the good old days when I was a boy with a heart full of fire and Mummy would teach me. (dreamy harp music) (whimsical clarinet music) - Okay, Henry, this is a horse. Can you say horse? - Ho, ho, divorce! - What, no. Okay, let's try this one. Can you say loaf of bread? - Ll, off with her head! - No, Henry, that's wrong! You know what, last one. Okay, can you say soap? Soap! - Sss, sss. - Yes. That's it. - I'm the supreme head of the church! Screw the Pope! - You know what? You're my son and I love you, but you're freaking weird, man. (light orchestra music) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The year is 1491. England has just come out of three decades of civil war in which a bunch of Henrys, Edwards, and one Richard had a little ding dong over which Royal house should rule the round. Finally, a Henry won, Henry VII, and he had a son. (whimsical orchestra music) - What should we name him? - My Royal lineage is full of Henrys, a fine name, a vigorous name, a tenacious name, a muscular name. - How about Arthur? - [Narrator] And so Arthur, Prince of Wales, and next in line to the throne was born. Five years later, Prince Henry was born, but nobody cares about him. He's not the heir, just a spare. the King wanted to make an Alliance with Spain. So one day, he said to his son, Arthur, 'Hey, baby, 'you see that lady, baby? 'That's going to be your wife.' - But father, I'm not even three years old yet. - Listen, there's something you have to understand. You're my son, but more than that, you're a political bargaining tool. - But you love me, right? - I love you as a political bargaining tool. - Yay. - Hey, pop. - Who the heck are you? - I've written you a poem. - Listen here, tiny man, can't you see that I'm busy? - But I'm your son. - I have another son? - [Narrator] as Arthur was in another palace being prepped to become King, (medieval orchestra music) Henry lived with his mother and two sisters at Eltham, where he was being trained for a church career, and not just that, Henry learnt languages. He played sports. He learned the recorder. What a nerd. Am I right? Wrong, Henry was the coolest kid around. (mellow jazz music) - So I told my Latin teacher he could kissius my buttius. (audience laughing) Anyway, here's Wonderwall. (crowd cheering) (upbeat xylophone music) - Great scholars and theologians from across Europe came to meet and teach the young Prince Henry, who by all accounts was a very enlightened, bright, and charming young boy. (crowd cheering) Everybody loved Henry, and out of everything Henry was taught more than anything, he came to adore and respect theology and Catholicism. One of Henry's tutors was English poet Laureate, John Skelton, who wrote a textbook for Henry that we still have today. In it, he wrote a number of important lessons for the young Prince, such as, 'Do not be mean,' 'loathe gluttony,' and 'Do not violate widows,' important lessons for any nine-year-old boy. (medieval orchestra music) Around this time, Henry's older brother, Arthur, now 15-years-old, was married to Catherine of Aragon sealing the union between England and Spain, (crowd cheers) and then he died. (crowd groans) (sad organ music) - Oh, my alliance with Spain. My poor, poor alliance with Spain. - And your son, sire? - Oh yes, of course, my son, but mostly my alliance with Spain. - Hey, pop. - Who the heck are you? Oh yeah! (whimsical orchestra music) - And just like that, an unprepared Prince Henry was now the new heir to the throne. And how about that alliance with Spain? Well, the solution was simple. - Hey, Boy, see that full grown woman over there? That's gonna be your wife. - What, my brother's widow? - Yes. - You're a fricking weirdo, man. - [Narrator] Now, in the Bible, there's a verse that says marrying your brother's widow, that's a big no-no. So the King needed to convince the Pope and get his special permission. - Hey, can I please have my son marry his brother's widow? - Eh, sure, why not? - [Narrator] And so it was. Henry's life was turned on its head as he was moved to the Royal court next in line to the throne, but tragedy struck when just a few months later, his mother with whom he was very close, suddenly died in childbirth. The loss of his mother almost certainly had a big effect on the young boy. (inquisitive orchestra music) In his older years, King Henry VII went on a bit of a paranoid trip. As was normal for a King at the time, Henry VII had had to quell a number of rebellions, and as he aged, he became ever more suspicious of the nobility around him. To keep them in check, he began levying huge ruinous fines left, right, and center. Dukes, Bishops, Barons, even his own mother, no one was safe from his tyranny, and the nobility of England began to suffer. So when Henry VII finally got sick and died just after Christmas, 1508, there was a lot of celebration, (cheering) (upbeat orchestral music) not only because the tyrannical Henry the seventh was gone, but because his replacement was the ever popular, charming, and handsome 18-year-old, King Henry VIII. Henry married Catherine of Aragon in June, 1509. You may be wondering, if it's so weird to marry your brother's widow and since he's now King, couldn't Henry just decide not to? Well, yes he could, but by now, Henry wanted to. The thing about Henry that was unlike many kings of the time was he married for love, and he'd grown quite fond of Catherine, very fond. Historians say their marriage was unusually good, and so he was coronated King and what a King. (crowd cheers) Compared to his tyrannical father, he was an absolute joy. Having the blood of two royal houses, he was widely supported. He was really, really, ridiculously good-looking and those famous calves could achieve world peace. (cat calls) - Hey Henry, now that you're King, you know what that means? (group cheering) COSTUME PARTY! (whimsical orchestra music) - Henry pranced around the palace playing dress up with his friends. He wrote plays. He sang songs. He danced. A true Renaissance man, very different from the gluttonous wife killer we think of today. In his early reign, people from near and far would come to ask favors of the generous king. - Hey man, could I gain ownership of some land near Upton Snodsbury? - Sure thing, pal! - Hey, could I be an Earl or a Baron or a Viscount or something? - Anything you want, man. - Could I get like, just like a really cool pig that has like freaking metal wings and eight legs and shoots flippin lasers and it can grow more pigs out of it for extra pigs? - Say no more. - Hey guys, I was just checking up on the financial report and what the hell? We can't afford this! - [Narrator] Henry's council that he inherited from his father weren't happy with all the money he was just throwing around and they worked hard to curb the king's spending. Since they controlled the royal seals needed to get stuff done, at first, they were largely able to control the young king, and for Henry, the most infuriating things of all was they wouldn't let him joust with his friends because it was too dangerous, nor would they let him do the thing he wanted most, to go on a great, glorious, and expensive conquest against England's historic enemy, France. - Please guys, I'll keep it cheap. - How? - I'm glad you asked.

(whimsical orchestra music) He wanted to go down in history. If you didn't go to war in France was he even the King of England? - Man, I want to go to war so bad, but the council won't let me. - Hey, maybe I can help with that. - Whoa, it's Cardinal Wolsey, one of my best friends, despite being an old ass man. - [Narrator] Cardinal Wolsey knew that if he helped King Henry, there'd likely be something in it for him. So what was his great intricate plan to curb the council's power? - You're the king, dumb-dumb. You can do whatever you want. - What? - [Narrator] Wolsey began writing bills that simply didn't require the seals, and thus, Henry was back on top. For his efforts, Wolsey began to climb the ranks, and he became something of a yes-man for King Henry, encouraging Henry to frolic and play while Wolsey took care of business. (Henry humming) - Hey kid, you want to go on an adventure? - Do I ever? - [Narrator] The Pope was at war with France and he needed some help. He offered the young impressionable King Henry 100 Parmesan cheeses, some wine, and a golden rose if he came to the Pope's aid, and Henry was all in. At this point in his life, he still respected the church and loved the Pope, and here was a chance for war he had been waiting for. He still didn't have an heir, a fairly big problem for a Monarch at the time, but right now, the only kind of smashing he was interested in was smashing French guys in the face, (groaning) and so off he went. (intense percussion music) The English already held the French city of Calais. From there, Henry made a glorious victory at the Battle of The Spurs. (armies yelling) He took the French cities of Therouanne and Tournai. Word of his victories spread. This was it. Here was the glory he had been waiting for. Back home, his beautiful wife also led armies to victory in Scotland, and better yet, she was pregnant. Soon, Henry would have an heir. All of Henry's wildest dreams were coming true. Oh, he ran out of money. As the French prepared to invade Italy, all Henry could do was go home. - Well, at least now I have an heir to cheer me up. (whimsical orchestra music) Bring me my son. - Henry, this is Mary. - Mary? That's a funny name for a boy. - Henry, it's a girl. (screaming) - [Narrator] This was Katherine's fifth pregnancy that had not resulted in a male heir. Happy Henry wasn't so happy anymore. - You still haven't given me a male heir. - Well, how do you know it's my problem? Maybe it's your problem, Henry. - It couldn't be my problem because I've been boinking half your maid staff, and one of them gave me a boy-uh. I mean, sure. Yeah, you know what? Maybe it's my problem. I'll look into that. - [Narrator] Cardinal Wolsey, now Henry's Lord Chancellor, knew his job depended on keeping Henry happy, and so he said, 'Well, if you can't be the great warrior, 'then how about the great peacemaker?' - Not as cool, but okay. - [Narrator] And so the Field of the Cloth of Gold, a glamorous peace summit between England and France was held. The king of France, Frances I, was essentially the French version of King Henry, and the whole thing was basically one giant codpiece measuring contest. The two sides did agree to a peace treaty. However, it didn't last long. You see, there was a third major player in European politics at the time, an exquisite specimen of Royal inbreeding, an heir to a huge inheritance, and a chin that could hit a home run, Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. he was Henry's wife's nephew. Henry had helped him out in the past to put down a Spanish rebellion, and now, the two wanted to make an alliance, and so a marriage was arranged. - Mary I'd like to introduce you to your 22-year-old, fully grown, adult cousin, and now, your future husband. - Ew, he looks inbred. - Mary, we're all inbred! (whimsical percussion music) - With their new alliance, Charles and Henry agreed to team up and relaunch a campaign against France. In 1522, the English landed and stormed as far South as Agincourt, but Charles didn't commit significant forces. - Whoops, sorry, man. Not sure what happened. I'll join in next year. - [Narrator] The next year, England swept Northern France, almost taking Paris, but once again, where was Charles? - Aw man, I'm so sorry. I promise next year I'll be there. - [Narrator] The next year came and a fed up Henry decided he was going to sit this one out, and just as Charles ravaged the French at the Battle of Pavia and captured the French King. (whimsical orchestra music) - Holy crap, dude. - Yeah, I totally kicked France's butt. - That's great! So can I have the French throne like we agreed? - Mmm, no. - What? - And also I don't want","The video humorously recounts the life of King Henry VIII, from his early days as the younger, lesser-known son of King Henry VII, to his rise to the throne after his brother Arthur's death.

"(intense organ music) - Hungary, 1474, the artist's hands shake as he sets up his easel and paints. Across from him sits a man infamous throughout the land. Some call him a hero, the only man willing to defend Eastern Europe from the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. While others say he's a monster, a fiend who impales men, women, and children on long spikes and feasts beneath their jerking corpses. And according to one story, he dips his bread in the warm blood that splatters his plate. This legend in front of the artist has a face that matches the stories, a sharp nose, heavy eyebrows, and bulging green eyes. For over a decade, the man has been a captive here, but soon he'll be unleashed again. Vlad III, Son of the Dragon, Dracula. Though, before we take a bite out of this legendary tale, we want to thank Nebula for helping to make this episode possible and remind you that after this episode, you should go check out our next Extra History series on Nazi Occultism over there, a full week earlier than anywhere else by clicking the link below. (intense music) Welcome friends, today we will be discussing Vlad the Impala, aka Dracula, a 15th century Romanian ruler, who.. Vlad, Vlad, I'm doing a bit. All right. All right, take the fangs out. Ah, kind of hurt anyway. Actually, it's for the best because as fun as it is to make vampire jokes, the true story of Vlad the Impaler is actually more interesting, revealing, and dare I say, bloody than the literary counterpart that stole his name. Vlad III, later known as the Impaler, is by far the most famous Romanian historical figure, but he's famous in a strange sense. In his homeland, he's a national hero, seen as a champion of independence and resistance against Ottoman expansion. But outside Romania, he's mostly perceived as the psychopath and sadist that inspired Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'. In fact, word of his violent deeds spread even during his lifetime as print makers in Germany churned out exaggerated or invented stories about him. In other words, centuries before Stoker's birth, Vlad's story was already intertwined with myth, which makes him difficult to talk about. So just to state this upfront, our plan with this series is to first discuss the historical Vlad and then do a separate episode on the complex legacy of his memory. Where yes, we promise we'll talk about all the 'Dracula' stuff because actually 'Dracula' is Rob's favorite classic novel, and we did an entire episode on that book on our literary show, 'So You Haven't Read'. It's awesome. I love it. And you should definitely go take a bite out of that after you finish learning about Vlad here. But okay, back to history. To understand Vlad the man, we have to go back to the time of his father, Vlad III, known as Dracul or the Dragon. Vlad Dracul got that name after Sigismund, King of Hungary, and later the Holy Roman emperor made him a member of the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order that vowed to defend Eastern Europe from the Ottoman Empire. These two, they were close. See, Vlad II grew up as a hostage at Sigismund's court, a common practice then, which was half like going to boarding school and half like well being a hostage. Vlad's father, the ruling prince of Wallachia, had agreed to be a vassal of the Hungarian King. With Vlad living within decapitating distance of the Hungarian throne to keep his father honest. I.e. Betray me and I kill your kid. Yet Sigismund was pretty chummy with Vlad, educating him and showing him favor because Sigismund's ideal outcome wasn't for Vlad to die. It was for him to succeed his father and rule Wallachia as a close ally of Hungary. But why, I mean, why would Hungary, much larger than it is today, put so much effort into controlling a relatively small principality? Well, as they say in real estate, location, location, location. Wallachia was essentially the buffer zone for a major conflict brewing in Eastern Europe. The expansionist Ottoman Empire had rolled over the Balkans, and the then powerful kingdom of Hungary wanted a friendly ruler in Wallachia to keep it free of Ottoman control, and the famous Ottoman Janissaries off Hungary's borders. But the throne of Wallachia was a bit of a mess and keeping anyone on it was a big project. Vlad Dracul's own father had been Prince twice before he died in 1418, and five other of Vlad's cousins and half Brothers had also sat on the throne by 1436. Some multiple times. That's because monogamy was more of a suggestion for Wallachian nobles rather than a strict rule. And that created an enormously twisted family tree of backstabbing and usurpation. That meant the average time on the throne during Vlad Dracul's lifetime was only around two to three years. But it wasn't until 1434 that Sigismund thought about a regime change. That's of course when one of Vlad's brothers, currently the prince, sent envoy to pledge allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II. In response, Sigismund gave Vlad a bunch of money to raise an army of exiled Wallachian boyars, basically the noble class, to cease the throne. He succeeded in 1436, mostly because his brother died of an illness, and Vlad's first act was to cancel the unratified treaty, his predecessor had drawn up with the Ottomans. Then two things happened. First, the Ottomans invaded in response, then a month later, Sigismund died, triggering a Hungarian internal crisis that meant Wallachia wasn't going to be getting any of its promised military aid. So Vlad Dracul decided to forego that whole Order of the Dragon, battle the Turks thing, pledged fealty to Murad II and guided an ottoman army into Hungary. But that Ottoman force was defeated, leaving the Hungarian furious with Vlad. See, the problem that would Bedevil Vlad and his son Dracula as well, was that Wallachia was a small country between big powers, and siding with one invited the other to either attack him militarily or to try to put another relative on the Wallachian throne. In 1442, Vlad took a meeting with John Hunyadi, a Hungarian vassal and Prince of Transylvania. Remember him, he's important. Who convinced Vlad to withdraw his support from a planned Ottoman invasion of Transylvania. Vlad hoping to stay neutral, didn't join the invasion, but did let Murad's forces cross Wallachia to attack Hunyadi. Now, it was Murad II who was furious with Vlad, and when he called him in for an explanation, he jailed him along with his two youngest sons, only releasing him to reclaim his throne once he'd sworn not to act against Ottoman interests and pledged to send 500 children a year to join the elite Ottoman Janissary Corps. But when he was released from Ottoman custody, he left a few things behind, namely his 11-year-old son, Vlad III, known by his preferred honorific of Dracula or Son of the Dragon. Oh, that's right, just like Daddy Dragon got ditched as a hostage at Sigismunds court. This little dragon got left as a hostage with the Ottomans, along with his brother Radu, who is around seven. And these two brothers couldn't have been more different. Radu got along just fine at the Ottoman Court. He was charming, intelligent, and good looking, eventually even earning the title, Radu the Handsome. He befriended the Sultan son, Mehmed II and his studies in Turkish, the Qur'an, logic, mathematics, and philosophy, flourished. Vlad, on the other hand, didn't get on so well. Neither charming nor handsome, he got none of the fawning attention Radu received, and his defiant attitude meant he regularly felt the lash of a Tudor's whip. Yet while they were generally well-treated, they were also in danger. A fact brought home when the brothers saw two boys, fellow Eastern European hostages blinded with red hot irons as punishment for communicating with their father. As always, Vlad's bulging green eyes saw everything. He saw the Ottoman Court, memorizing its functions and ways. He observed military drills closeup, and was raised along with Mehmed, gaining firsthand knowledge of a future enemy. He observed the terror tactics the Ottoman states used to keep vassals and populations in line, and he learned another hard lesson that politics wasn't personal, betraying your family was okay if it gave you more power. Then one day a messenger arrived saying that Vlad and Radu's privileges were being stripped. They would now live in harsher conditions, separated from the court for it seems their father, the Dragon knowing it would mean the death of his sons had joined John Hunyadi in a crusade to eject the Ottomans from Europe, which didn't go very well. The crusaders marched to total defeat. And then in the fallout, Vlad Dracul gave confusing signals of which side he was actually on. But ultimately, he resubmitted himself as a vassal to Sultan Murad, allowing Vlad Dracula and Radu, who he was surprised to learn were still alive, to come home. Yet, as I'm sure you've gathered by now, in making this piece, Vlad Dracul had invited war because now John Hunyadi stormed into Wallachia, hoping to put a pretender named Vladislav on the Wallachian throne because this story really needed more guys named Vlad. Vlad Dracula and Radu the Handsome fled back to the Ottomans. While their eldest brother, who stayed to fight with their father, got caught by a group of rebel boyars who blinded him with a red hot poker and buried him alive. And days later, Hunyadi and his men ran down Vlad II in a marsh. The Dragon was dead. His throne given to a pretender, which meant that now in 1448, it was finally time for young Vlad to enter Wallachia and reclaim what was his. So with military support from the Ottoman Sultan, the Son of the Dragon marched to his revenge, and Dracula was unleashed. (intense music) Ottoman Empire, 1447. This is how Romanian folklore says it happened. When Vlad Dracul was being run down in a marsh. When he knew that he'd be caught and killed by the pretender Vladislav, he gave his sword and pendant to a loyal boyar. - [Vlad II] Take them to my son. - [Narrator] For five days, the boyar rode, evading enemies and crossing rivers until he entered the Ottoman Empire and presented them to Vlad Dracula. And as the boyar recounted the deaths of his father and brother, Dracula stood staring at the sword and pendant, both given to his father by Sigismund, both marked with the iconography of the Order of the Dragon. And there the 17-year-old Vlad Dracula swore that he would not rest until he had avenged his murdered kin, and that he would personally, with his own hand, slay the pretender, Vladislav. While the story we started with may be folklore, it does capture a solid truth. When John Hunyadi's invasion killed Vlad's father and brother, it put the teenage hostage into play. Murad seems to have told Vlad of the deaths himself and then followed it up by making him an officer in the Ottoman military, because despite the greater popularity of his younger brother, Radu, Vlad's seriousness and determination had convinced Sultan Murad that this was the Prince they wanted ruling Wallachia as an ally. And considering how brutally Hunyadi and his allies had killed Vlad's family, Murad also assumed that any chance of the young Prince defecting to the Hungarians was most likely buried alive with Vlad's older brother. Plus, it was the perfect time to reclaim Wallachia for the Dracul Dynasty. For when John Hunyadi and Vladislav marched into Ottoman held Serbia, Murat had dealt them a shattering defeat outside Kosovo. In fact, the route was so chaotic that no one even knew if Hunyadi or Vladislav had survived. Seeing his chance, Vlad stormed into Wallachia with a Turkish cavalry force and seized the throne, a dramatic beginning to a powerful and bloody reign. Soon, Vlad would take revenge on the boyars who had betrayed his father and brother and would carve a swath across all of the land of, wait, no, oops, sorry. Funny story, Vladislav actually turned up, both very alive and with an army, recaptured the throne and sent flawed back into exile. His first rain lasted all of two months. At first, he fled back to the Ottomans, but things weren't safe there either. Vladislav, though he'd accepted Hunyadi's help to be installed on the throne of Wallachia under the explicit agreement that he'd fight the Turks, was discovering the same thing Vlad's father had. Wallachia simply couldn't survive against the Ottomans without Hungarian aid, and Hungary was a mess. Soon Wallachian boyars pressured him to make peace with the Sultan. So he sent Envoy to Sultan Murad looking to strike a deal, and Vlad rightfully worried his death might be a condition of the bargain, fled to Moldavia. And Vlad received a warm welcome there. For that year, his uncle had become the ruler of Moldavia and his cousin Stephen, the heir apparent. And the three years that Vlad spent there connecting with his cousin and getting a Renaissance education were likely some of the happiest of his life. He even got a taste of military glory, helping his uncle and cousin turn back a Polish force, good days. Though the time was abruptly cut short when his uncle's half-brother assassinated him and Vlad and Stephen both fled to Hungary where he was forced to play cat and mouse with John Hunyadi. Going from town to town, hiding with sympathetic boyars, and at one point slipping away just as a squad of ambushes tried to catch and assassinate him. Then everything changed again. First Sultan Murad died, and in his place rose his more vigorous and ambitious son, Mehmed, who declared it his top priority to finally conquer Constantinople, a goal made possible, since while the city was still a trade center and symbolically important, it had declined in military power. Hunyadi's star was falling as well. While he was still revered as the most famous crusader against the Turks, his two recent defeats had tarnished his reputation. I mean, a few years before he'd essentially ruled Hungary on behalf of a child king, but now he was back to just be in a plain old Prince of Transylvania. And then Vladislav, well, Vladislav was aligning ever closer with the Ottomans, meaning Hunyadi was suddenly shopping for a new prince of Wallachia, which set up an interesting space for an approach between Hunyadi and Vlad because each did have something the other wanted. Hunyadi could give Vlad legitimacy, official recognition in Hungary and a path to reclaim his throne. And in turn, Vlad could give Hunyadi an able partner who knew the Ottoman","Vlad III, known as Dracula, was a 15th-century Romanian ruler caught between the conflicting powers of the Ottoman Empire and Hungary. His father, Vlad Dracul, had pledged fealty to Hungary but later allied with the Ottomans, leading to family betrayal and imprisonment. After his father's death and the murder of his brother, Vlad III, then a hostage, vowed revenge and regained Wallachia's throne with Ottoman support, starting a brutal reign marked by retribution against his enemies. His rule was repeatedly challenged, including by the Hungarian-backed Vladislav, and after several exiles and shifting alliances, Vlad's eventual rise to power became inseparable from the violent tactics that earned him the title of 'Impaler.'"

Okay, Mrs. Bonaparte, this is it, one last push and we're done. Congratulations! It's a general. Oh, and here comes the rest of the army now. Did you just say the rest of the army? (fanfare music) History is full of great conquerors many with very impressive origin stories. For example, Alexander The Great was the son of a king. Julius Caesar came from an aristocratic family that descended from a goddess. Great conquerors don't usually come from relatively insignificant families living on impoverished islands, but as it just so happens that is where our story begins. In the early 18th century, The Island of Corsica was a part of the Republic of Genoa until one day Corsica said, Hey we're declaring independence and it's probably not worth your time to try and stop us. So Genoa said, you're right, it isn't worth our time. Hey France, you want to buy this island? And France said, sure thing. And thus Corsica became France just in time for Napoleon to be born French. Many Corsicans didn't appreciate their new conquers however. And from an early age, Napoleon developed some fairly anti French sentiments. Napoleon's dad, however, quickly embraced his new French overlords which created some tension between dad and son. Ooh. Look at me. I'm dad. I wear powdered wigs and silver buckled shoes. And I'm a trader to the Corsican people. Go to your room Napoleon. No, you go to your room, dad. Okay. On the other hand, Napoleon adored his mother who was definitely the disciplinarian of the family. And even though she would punish Napoleon severely, he kind of respected that. But Napoleon's parents wanted the best for their family. And since they were a very minor nobility they were able to have Napoleon sent off to the shining lights and rat-infested sewage puddles of the big city. Napoleon went to military school in France. Okay. Napoleon, why don't you introduce yourself to your new classmates? Well, I'm Napoleon, and I hate all of you. Your farts smell like cheese. You can't pronounce the letter R. All you do is go on strike. And you call eggs 'oeufs' like a bunch of big dumb idiot dingleberries. Okay, thanks Napoleon. I hope you like being bullied. And bullied he was. They picked on him for his Corsican accent, his family's lack of wealth, and it probably didn't help that he also had a bit of a chip on his shoulder, but he could hold his own. And on an average day, might be found dishing out ratatouille sandwiches for breakfast. He spent much of his time alone, and he loved reading about the great conquerors of history. He learned about Julius Caesar, and he wondered if one day he too might have a pizza franchise named after him, (funky music) He excelled at math and geography, and when he graduated at the age of 16, he was made second Lieutenant in an artillery regiment. Now, Second Lieutenant might sound pretty sweet to a screw up like you, but Napoleon had a little something called ambition, stonks of it. And he wasn't content being just some junior officer. He wanted to rise the ranks. Unfortunately for him, that would be a little difficult. Well, Napoleon I've reviewed your application, it's clear you're very skilled and would be a perfect fit for the promotion. And Simeon, you're just about the biggest idiot I've ever seen. Your test results suggest you have the mental aptitude of a senile earthworm. And in the part of the form where you list your experience, you seem to have drawn a picture of a gerbil giving birth to a shoe, but your dad is the Marquis de la Foofayette, so, you get the job. (Simeon screams) French society was just too closed off. Positions were handed out based on nobility, not talent. And the young Napoleon probably felt stuck. Wouldn't it be nice if, say, a revolution came along, and changed all of that? Well, what are the chances? The French revolution is here. Bastille toppling, head chopping, king popping, the revolution promised to do away with the old social hierarchy and make everyone a little more equal. Napoleon may not have cared much for the violent mobs, but if it meant he could rise the ranks, he was in. He began fighting to defend the revolution. He put down a British sponsored counter-revolution into Toulon and got promoted. He put down a royalist uprising in Paris and got promoted. And as his military prowess became more recognized he was even given his very own army. It was astonishing progress for such a young man of humble origins and Napoleon's wildest dreams were coming true. But Napoleon also believed he could increase his social status if he married an older rich lady. And so around this time, Napoleon went on the prowl. However, if some sources are to be believed, he was a verified creep. He reportedly had terrible luck with woman and most wanted nothing to do with him. Fortunately, he eventually met Josephine an aging single mother who was deeply in debt, and needed stability. So she agreed to marry him, despite finding him intensely disgusting. Napoleon you dirty dog, you've done it. Unbeknownst to Napoleon however, Josephine had a bit of a promiscuous reputation. Hey Napoleon, I hear you're marrying Josephine. Boy, she sure is a great kisser. That's right. Hey, wait, what do you mean she's a great kisser? Hey Hugo! You hear Napoleon's marrying Josephine? Wow. She sure is a great kisser. Now hang on just a minute. Hey everyone! Napoleon's marrying Josephine! (crowd talks over each other) Oh for goodness sake, is there anyone here who hasn't kissed my wife? Yeah, you. (crowd laughs) As Napoleon fell madly in love with his new wife. She fell madly in love with a man named Hippolyte. It wouldn't be long however, before Napoleon would leave home and go to war because while France was having its revolution, tensions in Europe were rising. Hey Austria, you'll never guess what we just did. What's that France? I got two words for you, Revo, Lution. We totally just socked it to our monarchy! What, dude, the rest of us are monarchies. You've just totally threatened the balance of power in Europe. Now we have to worry about our stinky peasants rising up against us. I mean, holy hell your Queen is Okay, France. This is pretty awkward. And the rest of Europe is probably itching to give you a wedgie, but you're not ready for a war yet. So you gotta be cool man. It's absolutely crucial that you say something to diffuse the situation, right now. Preposterous! I declare war. Sacrébleu! So France ended up at war with basically the rest of Europe, and the war of the first coalition began. At first France struggled, but then they started to do surprisingly well. And in many conquered territories they began to establish sister republics, exporting their revolutionary ideas across Europe. In 1796, they planned a three-pronged attack to take Vienna and knock Austria out of the war with two magnificent armies in the north to kick ass, and Napoleon in the south, as a bit of a diversion. For the first time, Napoleon would lead a military campaign. This was his chance to prove himself, to be somebody, and what a general, he proved to be. The army he was given were demoralized, lacking equipment, and underpaid, but Napoleon galvanized them with inspirational speeches. And he took them into Italy. He was outnumbered and his campaign was partially meant to be a sideshow, but he made it the main show. While the two Northern armies were being held back, Napoleon made staggering progress. In a signature Napoleon move, he masterfully split his enemies into two and took them on separately, knocking Sardinia out of the war, and putting the Austrians on the run. At the famous Battle of Lodi, he was in the fray, aiming the canons himself, getting covered in mud, and earning the total respect of his men. They respected him so much, that when he ordered an almost suicidal assault on the only bridge in town, his men threw themselves at it and took it despite fierce Austrian resistance. For Napoleon, it was all he needed to confirm that he was the greatest human who had ever existed. Wow Napoleon, you're pretty great at this military stuff. Just be careful, your head doesn't get too big. What did you just say to me you little prick? And as Napoleon swept through Northern Italy, the Italians cheered his arrival. Yes! I'm here to liberate you from your cruel Austrian oppressors. And replace them with French ones. Napoleon plundered as he went, sending riches back to France to help its economy, but also paying his men the first real money that's seen in years. The Pope had been supporting the Austrians, so Napoleon briefly went to go give him a slap. And as he began to approach Vienna, the exhausted Austrians were forced to make peace, with Napoleon overseeing negotiations himself. He had just single-handedly knocked Austria out of the war. And by the way, he was only 28. So maybe it's about time you moved out of your dad's attic. In the Italian territories he had conquered, Napoleon established new French sister republics, even writing constitutions and organizing governments himself. Not something a general generally does. When he got back to France, he was hailed as a hero and the extremely unpopular government were concerned he might get some power hungry ideas. So they agreed he should go far away from France, to Egypt, where he could maybe undermine British access to India. Napoleon was eager to win more glory. So he brought with him a team of scholars, and he was like, whoa it's a freaky man cat. Whoa, it's a big stick. Whoa, It's an ugly horse. Whoa, it's a stumpy little manlet. Hey, I'm actually average height for the time. But then British Admiral Nelson came down and wrecked his fleet. And an Anglo-Ottoman force defeated him at Acre. So Napoleon abandoned his men and went back to France. His campaign in Egypt hadn't gone quite as planned. But one thing you should know about Napoleon was that he was a skilled propagandist. He published his own newspapers that sometimes exaggerated his achievements and even commissioned paintings that generally made him look cool. So when he returned to Paris, he was yet again, hailed as a hero, and he began to get some power hungry ideas. First however, he had a bit of a problem to deal with. See, he had learned something shocking about his dear wife. Really Josephine, this guy? I'm just as tall as him. I'm sorry. I swear, now that you're becoming famous, I'll never do it again. Make sure you don't. I've never stooped so low as to cheat on you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in this room, consulting my generals for the next 30 minutes. And by consulting, I mean boinking, by my generals, I mean this woman and by 30 minutes, well I mean two seconds. Having dealt with his wife, Napoleon was then approached by a very influential politician, who said he had an idea. He wanted to stage a coup against the deeply unpopular government and needed the extremely popular Napoleon's help. And Napoleon thought that was just the darn tootin'est idea. The plan was to trap the government and convince them to voluntarily give up their power. And here's how they did it. Hey guys, oh my gosh, quick! There's a dangerous Jacobin plot to overthrow you which we definitely aren't just making up. Better get inside this cage so we can protect you. Okay. Gentlemen, we got them. (cheers) In this case, the cage was an isolated palace outside of Paris, with no one around but Napoleon and his army. With the government inside, Napoleon then entered and a pretty chaotic event ensued. During which, the government didn't seem entirely sure what was going on, Napoleon's men didn't seem entirely sure what was going on, and Napoleon himself didn't seem entirely sure what was going on. But thankfully Napoleon's brother Lucien, President of the Lower House, managed to regain control and the remaining councilmen were intimidated into creating a new constitution. And thus, a new government was formed. This time with three Consuls in charge. But after Napoleon did some rewriting, in the end there was really only one man in charge, the first Consul, him. And over the next few years, he worked to consolidate even more power and essentially became a dictator in total control of France, who, by the way, he was only 30. So maybe it's about time you washed your disgusting bedsheets. France was now ruled by possibly the greatest military leader of the time. Possibly the greatest? Or definitely? Well now is his chance to prove it. See, back when Napoleon was still in Egypt, being Indiana Jones, back home France was in France, being France. They had conquered even more territory and they were like hey Piedmont, you get revolutionary ideals. Hey Switzerland, you get revolutionary ideals. And Rome, you get revolutionary ideals. Everybody gets revolutionary. Oh, Hey guys, nice sledgehammers, and Naples, very cool nail gun. You guys here to get some revolutionary ideals? (screams) Sacre bleu! As France was still spreading the revolution, And with Napoleon busy in Egypt, the European powers felt the time was right for round two. And the War of the Second Coalition, began. And this time they're big, bad boy buddy Russia was here to bang some French boys back to Bordeaux. And bang them, they did. France, got blasted. But then Russia pulled out after stalling in Switzerland. And now that Napoleon was in charge of the country he was ready to start blasting right back. He took command of The Army of the Reserve and he brought the fight to the Austrians. Now, there are many traits that made Napoleon a great military leader. I already mentioned one of them, how he was one of the boys, and commanded the total loyalty of his men. But now we see a second reason, the element of surprise. In 1800, Napoleon moved to Geneva and it looked like he was probably going to take on the Austrian forces in Germany. There's no way","Napoleon's rise to power began in Corsica, where he developed anti-French sentiments due to his family's strained relationship with France, but he later embraced opportunities during the French Revolution. After attending military school in France and facing bullying, Napoleon rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a general by his twenties. He gained fame after successfully leading campaigns in Italy, knocking Austria out of the war, and creating French sister republics. Despite a failed Egyptian campaign, his propaganda skills helped him maintain his heroic image. Upon returning to France, he seized power through a coup, consolidating authority and becoming a dictator by 30. Napoleon then led France through the War of the Second Coalition, using his military prowess and surprise tactics to achieve significant victories."

(At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly","The video humorously recounts the events leading up to the French Revolution, highlighting the economic and social disparities between the nobility and the impoverished peasants. King Louis XVI, burdened with France’s crippling debt, exacerbates the situation by financing the American Revolution, while the royal family continues to live extravagantly. The Third Estate, made up of the common people, grows increasingly frustrated with high taxes and inequality, culminating in their formation of the National Assembly. Tensions escalate when the king’s military presence in Paris sparks fears of repression, leading to the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, marking the beginning of the French Revolution."

You sure have a lot of dignitas! Kiss me! Okay. (imitates kissing) - [Timulus] Hey dad? - [Dad] Hi son, just reading the newspaper. What can I do for you? - [Timulus] Well, you know how you always say Rome is the greatest civilization in the world? - [Dad] It bloody well is! - [Timulus] Well, I was just wondering, what makes us so great? How did we come to be? - [Dad] Wow. My son! Boy, let me take you on a journey to this side of the room. The story of Rome begins with these beautiful baby boys going to town on some she-wolf mommy milkers. - [Timulus] That's gross. - [Dad] You're gross! Sorry, son. You're not gross. I love you. They're called Romulus and Remus and when they grew up, in 753 BC, they founded Rome But there was just one problem. They couldn't agree on which of them should be the king. - [Timulus] But they worked it out peacefully, right? - [Dad] Oh, heavens no! Romulus caved Remus's skull in with a shovel. Here's a picture. - [Timulus] Our first king committed fratricide? - [Dad] I know, look at his face! - [Timulus] When's the part where we become the greatest civilization, Dad? - [Dad] Well, you see, at first Rome was full of men. - Oh yeah! - I'm talking like a real sausage party. You know what I mean? - [Timulus] Yes, sir. - [Dad] So we invited some neighboring cities over for a big feast and then we literally kidnapped all of their women. Here's a picture. (laughs) Look at that one. She's like, bah! (Dad laughs) - This is messed up. - [Dad] You're messed up! Ugh, sorry, sorry. I'll be a better father. I promise. So then, finally, after centuries of monarchy, those tyrannical kings started getting a little too big for their britches, so we overthrew the kings and established Rome as a republic. - [Timulus] Is that when all the killing stopped? - [Dad] Oh, heavens no! That's when the killing surged, baby! We went wild and conquered the Latin League, the Samnites, the Etruscans! Woo, what a rush! - [Timulus] Dad, Rome seems pretty barbaric. - [Dad] You're barbaric! Oh, I forgot to tell you about the time a prophet told Saturn his son would one day overthrow him. So Saturn literally ate his own son, seconds after he was born. - [Timulus] I don't wanna see a picture. - [Dad] Here's a picture. - [Timulus] Dad! Look at that! - [Dad] Hmm? - [Timulus] That's messed up, man. Are we really this uncivilized? - [Dad] Hey, hey, if we were so uncivilized, would we use communal toilets where we all fart and poo together in one big stinky, steamy, dirty toilet room? - [Timulus] Yeah, dad, we would! - [Dad] Clean your butt with the sponge, Timulus! - [Timulus] But all these guys just used it. - [Roman] What's wrong with your son, bro? - [Timulus] I don't wanna be Roman. This is so weird. - [Dad] You're weird! Sorry, you're not weird. I'm sure you're probably fine. Huh? (Timulus screams) - [OverSimplified] The Roman Republic, the nation that, since its foundation, had been stabbing necks all the way down the Italian peninsula. But this isn't the famous Roman Empire that ruled the known world. Not yet, anyway. This is a relatively juvenile Rome, (Rome passes gas) still just a regional power. In 264 BC, the big daddy of the Western Mediterranean was Carthage. Let's rewind a bit. Carthage was founded in 814 BC when some Phoenicians in Tyre had mega surplus of goods and decided to export those goods across the Mediterranean. They became the dominant trading power in the region and to support their growing trade network, the Phoenicians established a number of colonies, one of which was Carthage. Therefore, Carthage began its life as a Phoenician trade colony and the Carthaginians were actually Phoenicians, or, if you're a Latin speaking Roman, they were Punic, hence the name of the video. - Oh! - Over the centuries, Carthage gradually expanded and became the region's base of power. Just like Rome, Carthage was a semi-democratic Republic with its own Senate and Judiciary. But there were also some pretty hefty differences between the two. While Rome was big into farming and stabbing people in the neck, the Carthaginians, on the other hand, just like their Phoenician forefathers, had built their power through trade and navigating the waves. They went here and there, selling ivory tusks, gold, and slaves. And as a result, (Carthaginians cheer) they were rolling in it. Whenever they weren't busy swimming around in their copious hoards of money, in their spare time, they also possibly enjoyed sacrificing their children to Ba'al, the God of, let me just check my notes, ah, yes, plant fertility. - [Farmer] Oh boy, these figs aren't looking too hot. Maybe if I throw my son into a burning pit of fire, they'll grow. - [Son] Have you tried watering them, Dad? - [Farmer] Hmm. No, we'll try that second. - [OverSimplified] As a result of all their trading, Carthage had emerged as one of the Mediterranean superpowers. 'But wait,' they said. 'Rome? What the heck is that?' Well, I know it's a pretty obscure little country that you've probably never heard of, but this spunky young nation was about to upset the entire region's balance of power. Initially, the two sites enjoyed relatively friendly relations and it even signed a couple treaties. But it was a relationship that was practically destined to turn sour. See, Rome had a thing where they liked to aggressively expand their boundaries, often viewing such expansion as a defensive act. Kind of like when you could kill your neighbor because you knew eventually they would've tried to kill you first. Meanwhile, Carthage was extremely protective of its wealthy trade network. So if you put a very strategically important island between them, well, two plus two equals war. Tensions rose and the two sides began viewing each other with increasing disdain. The hardworking Romans looked across the water at the money-hungry Carthaginians and said, 'Look at those dishonest crooks. Bet they've never done an honest day's work in their lives!' And the Carthaginians looked back and said, 'Look at those simple-minded brutes. Bet they've never sacrificed a baby in their lives!' 'Yeah!' While war between the two superpowers seemed inevitable, the event that finally triggered it was a little unexpected. The whole thing began with a few simple mad lads on a wild night out. These mad lads are called the Mamertines. They were Italian mercenaries employed by the tyrant of Syracuse, here. But when he died, his successor said, 'Sorry, fellas, we don't need any big burly men with sharp sticks anymore. You can all go home.' - [Mamertines] Aw. - [OverSimplified] The Mamertines, as it turned out, didn't want to go home. So instead, they went to the nearby town of Messana and said, 'Hey man, we are but poor little buff boys without a home. May we come in?' - [Guard] Aw, poor fellas. Sure thing! Ah, ah, just so long as you promise not to massacre all of us. - [Mamertines] (laugh) We promise! - [OverSimplified] The Mamertines then massacred all of them. Well, not all of them, just the men. And they stole their homes and families. - [Mamertine] Ha, this is my house now! This is my Best Dad Ever mug now! And you guys are my new family! Son, wanna go play catch with your old papa? - [Son] You're not my real dad! - [Mamertine] Ugh, teenagers, am I right, dear? - [Woman] You're not my real husband. - [Mamertine] Ugh, I'm so trapped in this marriage. - [Woman] Then get out! - [Mamertine] No. - [OverSimplified] Messana was now controlled by the Mamertines and they began raiding up and down the Syracuse coastline. When the new ruler of Syracuse saw this, he wasn't happy. The Syracusans began fighting back and in response, the Mamertines said, 'Oh, crap, they're fighting back? What do we do?' - [Mamertine] Quick, we'll convince the Carthaginians to come and save us. Oh no! We're in trouble! And we need a big, strong empire to come and rub our bellies. - [Mamertine Leader] Why are you saying it like that? - [Mamertine] If I was a big, strong empire, I think I'd like to be seduced. (Carthaginians murmur) See, it's working! - [OverSimplified] The Carthaginians had long dreamed of controlling all of Sicily. They had been fighting Syracuse and their Greek influence on the island for centuries and now here was a great opportunity to get one over on them. So Carthage promptly answered the Mamertines's cry for help and sent a force to garrison Messana. As it turned out, however, some within the ranks of the Mamertines weren't too happy with the occupying Carthaginians and they sent out a second cry for help to Rome. When it reached the Roman Senate, they were a little more hesitant. Going to help the Mamertines ran the risk of triggering an all-out war with Carthage and they had only just finished conquering the Italian peninsula, so they were kind of tired. Plus the Mamertines were all the way across the water. They had never made a leap like that before. So you would assume that to avoid any conflict with Carthage, the exhausted Romans would probably sit this one out, But you would assume wrong. Rome just couldn't resist a good chance for war. Why? Well, there's something you gotta understand about Rome. See, as a Republic, they were hell-bent on preventing any one man from ever gaining too much power. And so rather than having one leader, Rome had two, called Consuls, who shared power. These Consuls could also only serve for one year at a time before new Consuls were elected. These measures, to limit the powers of the Consuls, were noble, but had an interesting side effect. The Consuls knew they had just one year to try and gain as much glory and prestige as possible, something that was very important in Roman society. And the best way of gaining glory and prestige? Military victory, of course. The Roman political system basically ended up encouraging these Consuls to go out and be as aggressive as your Italian grandmother when you don't eat all the spaghett. And so the glory-seeking Consuls convinced the people to vote in favor of going to Messana. And in they went. Upon the arrival of the Romans, the Carthaginians in the city, amongst the confusion, were forced to leave. Now in contrast to Roman aggression, the Carthaginian military had a slightly different philosophy. - [Teacher] All right, kids, listen up. If you wanna grow up to be Carthaginian military leaders, there's a few things you have to understand. If you fail to succeed on the battlefield, that's a crucifixion. Showing cowardice, that's a crucifixion. - [Warrior] Hello, sir. - [Teacher] Huh? What are you doing here? Aren't you meant to be in Messana? - [Warrior] Yeah, but the Romans showed up. - [Teacher] So you just left? - [Warrior] Sure did. - [Teacher] Oh, you better believe that's a crucifixion. (class cheers) - [OverSimplified] The Roman Consuls were awarded for victory and therefore tended to be aggressive go-getters. By contrast, the Carthaginian generals were brutally punished for failure and so they tended to be more cautious and restrained. This dynamic is helpful for understanding some of the crazy things that happened during the Punic Wars. So the Romans have crossed over to Messana and now there was some red on the island. Hit that panic button. (crowd screams) This turn of events was unacceptable to both Carthage and Syracuse. So the traditional enemies teamed up to kick the Romans off their island. They surrounded the city and said, 'Hey, you jerks, this isn't your island! Come out of there at once!' - [Romans] Okay, we're coming! - [Carthaginian] See, Phil. You just gotta speak with authority. That's what being an alpha male's all about. - [Romans] Hey man. - [Carthaginian] Oh, you brought your weapons and armor? No, I didn't mean. Oh, crap. - [OverSimplified] Out the Roman legions came to engage the Carthaginians in battle and they sent them packing. With the battle of Messana, whether intended or not, by going to help the Mamertines, the two sides had just slipped into an all-out war. With the initial Roman victory, towns across Sicily, including Syracuse began switching allegiance. Because being a winner is more fun. But the Carthaginians weren't about to just give up that easily. In 262 BC, they began building up their forces at Agrigentum. So the Romans, being aggressive go-getters, aggressively go got them. The Romans immediately laid siege, hoping to starve out the Carthaginian garrison. However, because this was the first time Rome had been fighting outside the Italian peninsula, across the water, they struggled to supply their forces. And before long, the Romans were as starving as the Carthaginians they were besieging. They had to forage for food, leaving them open to ambush. And when Carthaginian reinforcement arrived, creating a double siege, things got really bad. Everybody starved each other for months until nobody could take it anymore and they all finally came out for battle, which Rome won. - [War Counselor] Here's the report from the recent siege at Agrigentum, sir. - [Senate Member] We killed 30,000 while only suffering 7,000 losses? That's amazing! We're the best! - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. Whoops, those are the wrong way around. - [Senate Member] What? We lost 30,000? We're the worst! But we won, right? - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. - [Senate Member] But we also got our asses kicked? - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. - [Senate Member] So are we the best or the worst? - [War Counselor] Yes, sir. (Senate murmurs) - [OverSimplified] The Romans wanted Agrigentum because they were aggressive go-getters and they now began eyeing up the possibility of conquering the entire island. But they also suffered very heavy losses and it was clear they couldn't sustain a campaign if they couldn't supply their troops. Here's the issue. Sicily was an island. Islands are surrounded by water. A strong navy would be vital for supplying troops and winning the war. Here was Carthage's navy and here was Rome's. (water splashes) I think you can see the problem. Historians debate just how much naval experience Rome had at this point. Presumably,","The video humorously outlines the early history of Rome, starting with the myth of Romulus and Remus and their violent founding of the city. It describes Rome's expansion, the overthrow of monarchy for a republic, and its barbaric early actions, such as kidnapping women and engaging in fratricide. The rise of Carthage as a trading superpower is juxtaposed with Rome's expansionist ambitions, leading to tensions. The conflict between the two powers begins with the Mamertines' appeal to Carthage and then Rome, sparking the First Punic War. The Romans, eager for glory, intervene, leading to a series of battles and the struggle to control Sicily, despite challenges in naval power and heavy losses."

A young man by the name of Benito Mussolini moves from Italy to Switzerland to avoid military service. He gets big into socialism, working for trade unions, writing for socialist newspapers, advocating a violent overthrow of European monarchies, the whole shabang. This gets him in a bit of trouble with the Swiss police. So he gets arrested, sent back to Italy, set free, returns to Switzerland, is arrested again, goes back to Italy again, completes his military service after previously avoiding it, and then after a brief stint as an elementary school teacher, he finally returns to work as an avid socialist. His speeches and journalistic abilities made him famous among Italian socialists. He was anti-war, so when Italy colonised Libya in 1910, he rioted. And got arrested. Then WW1 came along, and once again, he protested Italy's involvement. But then he thought, 'Wait a minute.' 'This war could bring about the social climate needed to overthrow European monarchies, and bring about the socialist revolution everywhere.' And suddenly he was pro-war. But his fellow socialists didn't like his new pro-war stance, so they kicked him out of the party. So then he said, 'You know what? I'm done with socialism. We need something new. Not based on class divisions tearing us apart, but based on unity through nationality. We'll conquer the Mediterranean, and reunite all Italian peoples, just like the days of the Roman Empire. I'll call it 'Fascismo' and it will guide the Italian nation to greatness.' 'That's all well and good, Mr Mussolini, but what kind of haircut am I giving you?' 'Let's go with... bald.' ♪ Tchaikovsky - 1812 Overture ♪ Italy had been on the winners' side in WW1, and they hoped they were going to get a lot out of it. But in the end, they only got a little, and they felt cheated. On top of that, a bad economy, and weak governments meant that the Italian people were a little unhappy. So when Mussolini came along, and said that he could fix everything, his fascist movement gained a lot of support. In 1922, he went to the King and said, 'Make me prime minister, or I'll make me prime minister.' And the King said, 'You and what army?' 'This army.' 'Fair enough.' Then he went about establishing a dictatorship with himself at its centre. Europe had its first fascist dictator. Next up: Germany. Germany had been on the losers' side, and they got absolutely wrecked by the Treaty of Versailles. They lost territory, had to demilitarise the Rhineland, had to reduce their army to just 100,000 men, couldn't have an airforce, had to pay the Allies a huge amount of money that it didn't have, and a new rule was established that every Englishman witheld the right to walk into the center of Berlin, pick out any German they wanted, and spank the hell out of them. I made that last one up, but it helps you understand how all of this felt to Germans. On top of that, a bad economy and weak governments meant that when a small, angry man with a silly moustache came along and said that he could fix everything, the German people loved it. Hitler had been a soldier during WW1, and he was crazy patriotic. And nobody was madder than him about Germany's humiliation. He helped start a new political party, and in 1923, attempted a march on Munich with his boys. And then he got arrested. But his popularity grew and grew, and in 1933, the President made him Chancellor. He believed he was Germany's great destined saviour, and he went full megalomaniac, establishing a dictatorship with himself at its center. Europe had Fascist Dictator No. 2. Hitler and Mussolini had a lot of the same ideas. But more importantly, they had the same enemies. And they started to get along. 'Anyone else wanna be friends? Franco? No? You good?' 'I do.' 'Who's that?' It's Japan. And they've taken over northern China. Let's rewind a bit - Japan had isolated itself from the rest of the world for over 200 years. Until the Americans showed up and said, 'You're going to trade with us, and you're going to like it.' Then the Western powers imposed a bunch of 'Unequal Treaties'. Meaning Japan's economy was bust. They also had no natural resources. So they decided to go get some. They went to war with China to gain a sphere of influence over Korea, and they took a bunch of China's stuff. But then the West said, 'Hey! Cut that out.' And since Japan couldn't take on the West, They said, 'Okay, I guess we'll just go home - Wait a minute! What are you doing?' 'Taking advantage of a weakened China and setting up spheres of influence.' 'But I was the one who weakened them.' 'We know.' 'And you guys didn't let me have anything.' 'We know.' 'That seems unfair.' 'We don't think so. Okay. See ya.' So Japan thought, 'Screw this!' and went to war with Russia, and stunned everyone by actually winning. Then they fully annexed Korea, but they didn't stop there. In WW1, they took Germany's colonies and islands in Asia. And then in an incident that was maybe staged by the Japanese army, a bomb blew up a Japanese train in Manchuria, giving them an excuse to launch an invasion and take over. So, here's the situation: Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and Japan, all believe they're racially superior. All feel hostility towards the Allies, and all want to militarise and take over more stuff. And so they did. Let's start with Germany. Hitler hated the Treaty of Versailles, and now he was ready to begin undoing it. In complete violation of the treaty, the first Luftwaffe squadrons were set up, conscription was introduced, and he pimped up his army. The Allies did nothing. Then Hitler sent his army back into the demilitarised Rhineland, giving orders to immediately retreat if the Allies showed up. The Allies did nothing. With his military restrengthened, he could now move on to Step 2. He wanted to rapidly increase the Aryan population. And to do so, he needed lebensraum, or in other words, he would have to take over the world. But for now, a good portion of Europe would do. And he began eyeing up his neighbours. The Allies finally started to get worried, so they implemented a fairly useless diplomatic strategy called appeasement. And it went a little something like this: Hitler would say, 'I want that thing.' And the Allies would say, 'You can't have that thing - Okay you can have that thing but no more.' 'I want that thing.' And repeat. In 1938, Hitler's army marched into Austria, and just took it, with no resistance. Boom. This is Germany now. Next, he demanded to be given the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with many ethnic Germans. The Allies held a meeting with Hitler in Munich and said, 'Look, we're going to give you wha -' 'HANG ON. This meeting is about my territory, shouldn't I come to the meeting too?' 'Anyway, we're going to give you what you want.' 'Really?' 'Yeah.' 'Just like that?' 'Yep.' 'What's the catch?' 'Just sign this piece of paper promising you won't invade the rest of Czechoslovakia.' 'Okay.' Then Chamberlain returned home victorious, waving his signed piece of paper in the air, declaring crisis to be averted, and the continuation of World Peace, and we built a statue of Chamberlain in his honour and every day on the 30th of September we celebrate Chamberlain Day - 'Hitler's invading the rest of Czechoslovakia.' 'What?' 'He's invading the rest of Czechoslovakia.' 'Oh. You lied to me.' 'What do you expect? I'm Hitler.' Not to be outdone, Mussolini also wanted to get in on the action. He thought to himself, 'Isn't there a not-yet-colonised nation somewhere which is so underdeveloped that the people would be defending themselves against our tanks with literal bows and arrows and wooden spears? Oh there is? Fantastic!' And so he took it. Italy also wanted to control the entrance to the Adriatic Sea. So they occupied Albania. Then, in another incident that was maybe staged by the Japanese, gunfire was exchanged by Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge. And the Japanese launched yet another invasion against China. They swept through Beijing and Shanghai, and then advanced through the Yangtze Valley to China's then-capital, Nanking. It was here that saw the worst of Japan's shocking atrocities committed against the Chinese people. Back in Europe, Germany and Italy made their relationship status official by signing the Pact of Steel. Then, Hitler turned his eyes towards Poland, and the hated Polish Corridor splitting Germany in two. At this point, the Allies really had to put their foot down. And they warned him that an invasion of Poland would mean war. Hitler had planned to continue his advance eastward, but he didn't want to end up fighting a war on two fronts. So for now he made an alliance with Stalin, saying, 'How about we both invade Poland and split it between the two of us, and I definitely won't not refrain from not betraying you sometime in the future.' 'Sounds... good.' This new alliance stunned the West. On the 1st of September 1939, German troops entered Poland, and Britain and France declared war on Germany. The Poles fought hard, but they were no match for the two giants crashing down on them from either side. Then came a period known as 'The Phony War', where everyone just sort of sat around not doing much. The French had launched a small invasion into the Saar Land, but they maintained mostly defensive positions, and after a while decided to just turn around and call it a day. Speaking of France, the French were still super proud of their victory in WW1. And they hadn't really moved on from it. They still used horses, they dispatched messages by motorbike instead of using the radio, orders from the commander-in-chief were usually pretty vague, and the troops were rarely inspected. They built a line of defenses along their German border, but didn't bother extending it all the way to the Channel, and they wouldn't launch artillery strikes against Germany out of fear of being retaliated against. In a war. They didn't want to attack the enemy. And at first, the UK wasn't much better. Chamberlain still naively hoped that the war could be ended diplomatically. Instead of bombing raids, the RAF dropped propaganda leaflets over German cities, which one air marshall said likely did nothing but provide the continent with toilet paper for the duration of the war. They also only sent 200,000 men to France, while the French had mobilised millions. Both Britain and France wanted to avoid a repeat of the First World War, and so they wanted to keep the war as far from home as possible. So they turned their eyes north, towards Norway. Neutral Sweden was exporting iron ore to Germany, through neutral Norway. So the Allies asked them if they could please stop exporting iron ore to Germany. But this request was refused. Then, the Soviet Union attacked Finland. So the Allies said, 'How about we land troops in Norway and move them across Sweden to go help out your good pal Finland? And then along the way maybe take control of all your iron fields.' But Norway and Sweden still said no. So the UK mined the waters around Norway to force any transport ships into international waters, and they also attacked a German tanker they found in the area. Hitler realised what the Allies were up to, and he quickly moved to secure his supply of iron ore. He launched an invasion through Denmark into Norway. The Allies rushed to land troops at quay ports along the coast, but Germany had taken control of Norway's airfields, and their air superiority decided to fight. The Allies had to retreat. After this slightly embarrassing failure, Chamberlain resigned. And was replaced with Winston Churchill, who had a slightly different approach to dealing with the Germans. Hitler's overall strategy was similar to Germany's WW1 strategy. Attack France, defeat France, knocking out the UK in the process, then turn on the Soviet Union and win the war. During the Phony War, the Allies had given Hitler enough time to prepare his forces. Now, he was ready to attack. The Allies had wanted to place troops in Belgium, but Belgium had refused. And in a move that surprised pretty much no one, Hitler launched an invasion to get around France's defenses. The Allies charged into Belgium at full speed, to meet the German invasion head-on, and it looked like a repeat of the First World War was coming. But this time, Hitler had a trick up his sleeve. Blitzkrieg. As the Germans advanced, they sent thousands of refugees westward, slowing down the Allies. Then, to the south, the French had left the Ardennes, an area filled with hills and forests, pretty under-defended, because they thought it was naturally impenetrable. Well, the Germans were about to penetrate it with everything they had. They smashed 50 Wehrmacht divisions through, and encircled the Allied armies at lightning speed. The best of the Allied forces were now trapped. The Germans squeezed in from all sides, taking out France's best armies, and","The video begins by highlighting Churchill’s diverse interests and suggests that he could have used Skillshare to further explore various subjects. The story then shifts to Benito Mussolini, tracing his journey from socialism to founding fascism, leading to his rise as Italy's dictator. Hitler’s rise in Germany follows, with both Mussolini and Hitler sharing similar ideologies and eventually forming an alliance. Japan's expansion in Asia is discussed, along with the growing militarization of the Axis powers. The video covers the Allies' ineffective response to Germany’s territorial expansions, including the invasion of Poland, the Phony War, and the eventual German blitzkrieg that led to France's defeat."

Okay, Mrs. Lincoln, this is it. One last push and we're done. (grunting) Nine months and four days ago. My father brought forth upon my mother himself and gave to her a child conceived in a shack in Kentucky and dedicated to the proposition that I will drink num-nums from a bottle and do little poo poos in my pantses for the next two to three years. Now, what is it babies do again? Oh yeah. (cries loudly) I am not touching that. Abraham Lincoln grew up with his relatively poor family in Kentucky, eventually moving to Indiana, and finally, Illinois. He read a lot of books, worked a lot of jobs, wrote some questionable poetry and finally entered the law profession. Despite being self-taught, he turned out to be a pretty clever and astute lawyer. In one case, a guy claimed he witnessed a murder at night and Lincoln was like, 'How could you have seen anything in the dark?' 'There was a bright full moon.' 'A what?' 'A bright full moon.' 'Can you say that again, please?' 'There was a bright full moon.' 'A dim half moon?' 'No, a bright full moon.' 'That's funny because according to this Almanac 'there was a dim half moon that night which makes you a liar!' 'Uh... 'Well, I got a bright full moon for y'all right here.' 'Now that's what I call a rebuttal.' (claps loudly) - [Narrator] Lincoln and his cheekbones, weren't only interested in law however, he also dabbled in the world of politics, serving as a legislator in both local and national assemblies. And what a time it was. Not even 100 years after the founding fathers wrote, all men are created equal. Politicians were already asking, yeah, but what does that mean exactly? It means all men. Yeah, but what does that mean... Exactly? And not just that states' rights versus the federal government. What are the executive powers of the president? Is cereal a soup? The founding fathers left some of these questions perhaps a little too open to interpretation. And the biggest question of them all was slavery, an ugly mark, and what should have been a revolutionary new nation based on liberty and democracy. Thomas Jefferson had written a condemnation of slavery in the declaration of independence, but out of fear of losing Southern State support, it was removed. Hey guys, do you think leaving this a little vague will create any unforeseen problems in the future? Cannonball. And those unforeseen problems were now beginning to rear their ugly heads. As the nation developed the North and the South developed along two very different lines and two very different cultural identities emerged. Northern cities began rapidly industrializing while the Southern climate allowed for large plantations of labor-intensive crops. As a result, one half of the country didn't rely on slaves while the other half had become economically dependent on them. In 1793, Eli Whitney's cotton gin caused the slave trade in the South to explode, while in the North a growing abolitionist movement was taking root. A general mistrust began to develop between the North and the South. As Northerners felt the South were hell bent on expanding slavery and fear spread throughout the South that the North wanted to take their slaves away. In 1819, there were 11 free states and 11 slave states, a perfect balance, a happy medium, a harmonious relationship. Hey guys, nice to meet you. I'm Missouri, and I would like to become the 23rd state. Hey buddy, welcome to the nation. We'll be happy to accept you as a free state. No, you don't. You're trying to get one over on us. Missouri is gonna be a slave state. Okay, listen why don't we just ask Missouri what it wants to be... Slave state. Well, then allow me to introduce to you the newest freshest state on the scene, Maine. Hey, you can't do that. And you can't have any more slaves things about this line. What? The issue of slavery is solved and it will never come up again. A few years later, it came up again. You see, as America expanded westward, each new state or territory that was added threatened to up and the delicate balance between the slave and free States. If one faction managed to outnumber the other, it could gain an easy majority and force its own ideals on the opposing side leaving a huge portion of the population, feeling spiteful and depressed. For awhile compromises, kick the can down the road and kept the volatile balance in check as new free and slave states were roughly added in Paris but then one landmass mass state just had to barge in and ruin everything as usual. (gun shots) The addition of Texas saw the United States enter into a war with Mexico, which they won, gaining a huge amount of land out West and creating even more problems. Hey guys, nice to meet you. I'm California and I would like to become the 31st state. Hey buddy, welcome to the nation. We'll be happy to accept you as a Southern slave state. No, you don't. You're trying to get one over on us. California is gonna be a free state. Okay, listen, why don't we just ask California what it wants to be and we can... Free state. Well, then allow me to introduce to you the territories of New Mexico and Utah able to freely vote for slavery themselves. Hey, you can't do that! And we can enter Northern territory anytime we want to recapture escaped slaves! What? The issue of slavery is solved and it will never come up again. (crowd shouts loudly) A few years later, it came up again. In 1854 a democratic Senator from Illinois wanted to build a really cool Chichi train here and proposed the territories of Kansas and Nebraska be created open to slavery, even though they were clearly above the Missouri compromise line. Obviously the Northern States were like, 'Hell no.' But the Southern Democrats who controlled Congress at the time were like, 'Well, if you love liberty and democracy so much, then you should let them vote on whether slavery should be legal or not.' And so it was. Huge numbers of pro and anti-slavery settlers rushed to Kansas to sway the vote in their favor. And while they were all there, they began to beat crap out of each other. One of the settlers was a man named John Brown, a former businessman who failed at just about everything he tried and went arguably insane. He was a radical abolitionist and dedicated much of his life to the underground railroad and freeing slaves. One night in revenge for an earlier rate by pro-slavery forces, he and his sons killed a number of pro-slavery settlers in the territory, helping to kick-start years of violence known as Bleeding Kansas. Kansas and Nebraska both eventually voted in favor of outlawing slavery. But from here, the tension began to grow at a rapid pace. In 1852 author Harriet Beecher Stowe penned Uncle Tom's Cabin, a bestselling novel that exposed the terrible cruelty of slavery to the world. How awful. How morally corrupted nation must be to allow such things to happen. Your majesty, what should we do about all the starving children working in the coal mines? Nothing! In 1854, the Republican party was formed, and Abraham Lincoln emerged as a leading figure. Southern Democrats viewed the new Republican party with mistrust, believing it to be radical and abolitionist. In 1856 a politician named Charles Sumner gave a speech in Congress, calling out slave owning Democrats with fiery language, 'If slavery was a woman, she'd be an ugly one. 'And the Senator from South Carolina 'would like to boink her.' Representative Brooks, do you have a rebuttal? I have a rebuttal, all right? Yeah, here's a rebuttal for you. (loud bangs) Come on, surely this isn't allowed. I dunno. I'll have to consult the rule book. Hmm, I can't find anything about caning a political opponent, but it says here I'm not allowed to wear a woman's underwear. News of the violence, on the Senate floor took the nation by storm. Southern slave owners sent representative Brooks new canes to replace his now broken one. And on the floors of Congress, politicians carried weapons in self-defense, which is never a good sign. In 1857, the Supreme court ruled in the Dred Scott Case that all people of African descent slave or free could not be citizens and therefore could not sue for their own freedom under any circumstances, undoing years of progress with the strike of a gavel. Now within all this bitter debate over slavery there were many nuances North versus South, Republican versus Democrat, States versus the federal government. But let's strip all of that away. For 4 million individuals living in America, this wasn't about political intrigue or party alignment. It was about the basic human right to be free. Men, women and children were stolen from their homelands and brought to the American continent where for generations they were considered to be property, forced to live in poverty and work from sunrise to sunset, plantation overseers did whatever they felt was necessary to get the most out of their slaves. Punishments were often barbaric. Families were regularly separated and parents could often only watch as their children were auctioned off, never to be seen again. Thousands of slaves took the treacherous risk of running away and abolitionists in the North helped many escape by the underground railroad. As bounty hunters entered the North to chase them down. Leading figures within the abolitionist movement included many significant free black men and women. But it's important to note that from many of the anti-slavery white individuals in the North, opposition to slavery was often an economic issue, not a moral one. As many worried large plantations would take their lands and livelihoods away. Abraham Lincoln knew that slavery was a moral evil and he regularly spoke out against it in powerful speeches that helped him rise through the ranks of the new Republican Party. He lamented at the hypocrisy of a great American nation meant to stand as a shining beacon of freedom while also enslaving 4 million men, women and children. He most famously declared in 1858 that a house divided against itself cannot stand, that one day, slavery in America would end. However, even Lincoln was cautious in his opposition. He didn't want to outlaw it entirely but simply prevent its expansion. So that given enough time he believed it would naturally die out. Thankfully history would force his hand. In October, 1859 one abolitionist decided he tried to single-handedly take down slavery by force. Who'd be crazy enough to even attempt such a thing? Ah, it's our good friend, John Brown. He planned to seize arms from an armory in the town of Harper's ferry, free the slaves there and continue South inciting a major slave uprising along the way, a noble cause, a bad plan, and terrible execution. Brown's van took the armory and some hostages but we're quickly surrounded by one Robert E. Lee and his US Marine. Brown was captured, and a couple of months later, he was executed for treason. Northerners sympathized with Brown, but Southerners were like you see this, they're coming for us. Soon, there'll be a million John Browns. A million John Browns? What on earth are you thinking about? The John Brown farm. Yeah, me too. To make matters worse, new Northern free States meant now the Southern States really were outnumbered and they were beginning to feel bitterly, spiteful and oppressed. Further fear began to spread in the South, when news broke that a relatively unknown figure had just secured the Republican party nomination for president. Abraham Lincoln mostly well liked among anti-slavery northerners had made some of the most powerfully worded speeches against slavery of any politician at the time. And now there was a chance that he and his cheekbones could become president, for the South, that would be too much. In the 1860 election, Lincoln's name, didn't even appear on the ballot in 10 Southern States, but much to their horror, when the final results came in Lincoln had won by an electoral college landside Lincoln himself tried to calm their fear. How many times do I have to tell you, I'm not gonna take away your slaves? Yeah, right honest Abe. We've had enough of you northerners. We're gonna go form our own country. You can't do that. Why not? Well, if you had won the election, would it be okay for us to leave? Of course not. Well, why not? Because that's not how victim mentality works. Many States felt that when they joined union they always withheld the right to leave it whenever they pleased. Many people living in 19th century, America often felt more loyalty to their state than to the nation. And now with the South feeling like it had lost its voice in the federal government, they were out of here. South Carolina was the first to go. And over a period of six months, one by one 11 slave States officially succeeded from the union with just four contested border States opting to remain. The succeeding States issued a number of official documents justifying their succession. South Carolina proclaimed that it was Northern States hostility to slavery that rendered the federal government illegitimate. Mississippi declared that their position was thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery and then a speech. The Confederate vice-president stated that the new Confederate government rested upon what he called the great truth of racial inequality. Revered American generals, such as Robert E. Lee opted to side with their States over the union. And with all the chaos, one New York lawyer wrote that rather than a bold Eagle America's national bird should be a debilitated chicken. And hey, I kind of like that. One man watching the crisis unfold knew it would be his job to solve it. Lincoln was just about to hop on a train and become the president of the United States of America. Hey man, you're hella ugly Grow a beard or something to hide that face. Hmm, good idea. Hmm. Still ugly With assassination plots already underway, Lincoln had to travel to Washington DC, under heavy disguise and protection. All along the way he received stacks of threatening letters. May the hand of the devil strike you down. You are destroying this country. Damn you every breath","Abraham Lincoln, born into a poor family, became a self-taught lawyer and politician, rising through the ranks while the nation grappled with slavery and states' rights. As the North industrialized and the South relied on slavery for its plantations, tensions grew, especially as new states and territories threatened the balance between free and slave states. Despite his opposition to slavery's expansion, Lincoln tried to avoid outright abolition, but events like John Brown's raid and the rise of the Republican Party pushed him toward stronger stances. His election in 1860 sparked Southern secession, with 11 slave states forming the Confederacy, leading to the outbreak of the Civil War."
"Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today we’re going to talk about The French Revolution. Admittedly, this wasn’t the French flag until 1794, but we just felt like he looked good in stripes. As does this guy. Huh? So, while the American Revolution is considered a pretty good thing, the French Revolution is often seen as a bloody, anarchic mess, which... Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I bet, like always, it’s way more complicated than that. Actually no. It was pretty terrible. Also, like a lot of revolutions, in the end it exchanged an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian regime. But even if the revolution was a mess, its ideas changed human history - far more, I will argue, than the American Revolution. [theme music] Right, so France in the 18th century was a rich and populous country, but it had a systemic problem collecting taxes because of the way its society was structured. They had a system with kings and nobles we now call the Ancien Régime. Thank you, three years of high school French. And for most French people, it sucked, because the people with the money - the nobles and the clergy - never paid taxes. So by 1789, France was deeply in debt thanks to their funding the American Revolution - thank you, France; we will get you back in World Wars I and II. And King Louis XVI was spending half of his national budget to service the federal debt. Louis tried to reform this system under various finance ministers. He even called for democracy on a local level, but all attempts to fix it failed and soon France basically declared bankruptcy. This nicely coincided with hailstorms that ruined a year’s harvest, thereby raising food prices and causing widespread hunger, which really made the people of France angry, because they love to eat. Meanwhile, the King certainly did not look broke, as evidenced by his well-fed physique and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie Antoinette also got to live in the very nice Palace at Versailles thanks to God’s mandate, but Enlightenment thinkers like Kant were challenging the whole idea of religion, writing things like: “The main point of enlightenment is of man’s release from his self-caused immaturity, primarily in matters of religion.” So basically the peasants were hungry, the intellectuals were beginning to wonder whether God could or should save the King, and the nobility were dithering about, eating foie gras and songbirds, failing to make meaningful financial reform. In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates General, the closest thing that France had to a national parliament, which hadn’t met since 1614. The Estates General was like a super parliament made up of representatives from the First Estate, the nobles, the Second Estate, the clergy, and the Third Estate, everyone else. The Third Estate showed up with about 600 representatives, the First and Second Estates both had about 300, and after several votes, everything was deadlocked, and then the Third Estate was like, “You know what? Forget you guys. We’re gonna leave and we’re gonna become our own National Assembly.” This did not please King Louis XVI. So when the new National Assembly left the room for a break, he locked the doors, and he was like, 'Sorry, guys, you can't go in there. And if you can't assemble, how you gonna be a National Assembly?' Shockingly, the Third Estate representatives were able to find a different room in France, this time an indoor tennis court where they swore the famous Tennis Court Oath. And they agreed not to give up until a French constitution was established. So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops to Paris primarily to quell uprisings over food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw this as a provocation, so they responded by seizing the Bastille Prison on July 14th, which, coincidentally, is also Bastille Day. The Bastille was stormed ostensibly to free prisoners - although there were only seven in jail at the time - but mostly to get guns. But the really radical move in the National Assembly came on August 4, when they abolished most of the Ancien Régime - feudal rights, tithes, privileges for nobles, unequal taxation, they were all abolished - in the name of writing a new constitution. And then, on August 26th, the National Assembly proclaimed the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, which laid out a system of rights that applied to every person, and made those rights integral to the new constitution. That’s quite different from the American bill of rights, which was, like, begrudgingly tacked on at the end and only applied to non-slaves. The DoRoMaC, as I called it in high school, declared that everyone had the right to liberty, property, and security - rights that the French Revolution would do an exceptionally poor job of protecting, but as noted last week, the same can be argued for many other supposedly more successful revolutions. Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble. Meanwhile, back at Versailles, Louis XVI was still King of France, and it was looking like France might be a constitutional monarchy. Which might've meant that the royal family could hang on to their awesome house, but then, in October of 1789, a rumor started that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere inside the palace. And in what became known as the Women's March, a bunch of armed peasant women stormed the palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Antoinette move from Versailles to Paris. Which they did, because everyone is afraid of armed peasant women. And this is a nice reminder that to many people at the time, the French Revolution was not primarily about fancy Enlightenment ideas; it was mostly about lack of food and a political system that made economic contractions hardest on the poor. Now, a good argument can be made that this first phase of the revolution wasn’t all that revolutionary. The National Assembly wanted to create a constitutional monarchy; they believed that the king was necessary for a functioning state and they were mainly concerned that the voters and office holders be men of property. Only the most radical wing, the Jacobins, called for the creation of a republic. But things were about to get much more revolutionary - and also worse for France. First, the Jacobins had a huge petition drive that got a bit unruly, which led troops controlled not by the King but by the National Assembly to fire on the crowd, killing 50 people. And that meant that the National Assembly, which had been the revolutionary voice of the people, had killed people in an attempt to reign in revolutionary fervor. You see this a lot throughout history during revolutions. What looked like radical hope and change suddenly becomes 'The Man' as increasingly radical ideas are embraced. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Meanwhile, France’s monarchical neighbors were getting a little nervous about all this republic business, especially Leopold II, who in addition to being the not holy, not Roman, and not imperial Holy Roman Emperor, was Marie Antoinette’s brother. I should note, by the way, that at this point, the Holy Roman Empire was basically just Austria. Also, like a lot of monarchs, Leopold II liked the idea of monarchies, and he wanted to keep his job as a person who gets to stand around wearing a dress, pointing at nothing, owning winged lion-monkeys made out of gold. And who can blame him? So he and King William Frederick II of Prussia together issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which promised to restore the French monarchy. At this point, Louis and the National Assembly developed a plan: Let’s invade Austria. The idea was to plunder Austria’s wealth and maybe steal some Austrian grain to shore up French food supplies, and also, you know, spread revolutionary zeal. But what actually happened is that Prussia joined Austria in fighting the French. And then Louis encouraged the Prussians, which made him look like an enemy of the revolution, which, of course, he was. And as a result, the Assembly voted to suspend the monarchy, have new elections in which everyone could vote (as long as they were men), and create a new republican constitution. Soon, this Convention decided to have a trial for Louis XVI, who was found guilty and, by one vote, sentenced to die via guillotine. Which made it difficult for Austria and Prussia to restore him to the throne. Oh, it’s time for the open letter? An Open Letter to the Guillotine. But first, let’s see what’s in the secret compartment today. Oh, there’s nothing. Oh my gosh, Stan! Jeez. That’s not funny! Dear Guillotine, I can think of no better example of Enlightenment thinking run amok. Dr. Joseph Guillotine, the inventor of the guillotine, envisioned it as an egalitarian way of dying. They said the guillotine was humane and it also made no distinction between rich or poor, noble or peasant. It killed equally. You were also celebrated for taking the torture out of execution. But I will remind you, you did not take the dying out of execution. Unfortunately for you, France hasn’t executed anyone since 1977. But you’ll be happy to know that the last legal execution in France was via guillotine. Plus, you’ve always got a future in horror movies. Best wishes, John Green The death of Louis XVI marks the beginning of The Terror, the best known or at least the most sensational phase of the revolution. I mean, if you can kill the king, you can kill pretty much anyone, which is what the government did under the leadership of the Committee of Public Safety (Motto: We suck at protecting public safety), led by Maximilien Robespierre. The terror saw the guillotining of 16,000 enemies of the revolution including Marie “I never actually said Let them eat cake” Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre himself, who was guillotined in the month of Thermidor in the year Two. Alright, so while France was broke and fighting in like nine wars, the Committee of Public Safety changed the measurements of time because, you know, the traditional measurements are so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed all the months and decided that every day would have 10 hours and each hour 100 minutes. And then, after the Terror, the revolution pulled back a bit and another new constitution was put into place, this one giving a lot more power to wealthy people. At this point, France was still at war with Austria and Britain, wars that France ended up winning, largely thanks to a little corporal named Napoleon Bonaparte. The war was backdrop to a bunch of coups and counter coups that I won’t get into right now because they were very complicated, but the last coup that we’ll talk about, in 1799, established Napoleon Bonaparte as the First Consul of France. And it granted him almost unlimited executive power under yet another constitution. And when he was declared First Consul of France, Napoleon proclaimed 'Citizens! The revolution is established on the principals with which it began. It is over.' By which he presumably meant that France’s government had gone all the way from here to here to here. As with the American revolution, it’s easy to conclude that France’s revolution wasn’t all that revolutionary. I mean, Napoleon was basically an emperor and, in some ways, he was even more of an absolute monarch than Louis XVI had been. Gradually the nobles came back to France, although they had mostly lost their special privileges. The Catholic Church returned, too, although much weaker because it had lost land and the ability to collect tithes. And when Napoleon himself fell, France restored the monarchy, and except for a four-year period, between 1815 and 1870, France had a king who was either a Bourbon or a Bonaparte. Now, these were no longer absolute monarchs who claimed that their right to rule came from God; they were constitutional monarchs of the kind that the revolutionaries of 1789 had originally envisioned. But the fact remains that France had a king again, and a nobility, and an established religion and it was definitely not a democracy or a republic. And perhaps this is why the French Revolution is so controversial and open to interpretation. Some argue the revolution succeeded in spreading enlightenment ideals even if it didn’t bring democracy to France. Others argue that the real legacy of the Revolution wasn’t the enhancement of liberty, but of state power. Regardless, I’d argue that the French Revolution was ultimately far more revolutionary than its American counterpart. I mean, in some ways, America never had an aristocracy, but in other ways it continued to have one - the French enlightenment thinker, Diderot, felt that Americans should “fear a too unequal division of wealth resulting in a small number of opulent citizens and a multitude of citizens living in misery.” And the American Revolution did nothing to change that polarization of wealth. What made the French Revolution so radical was its insistence on the universality of its ideals. I mean, look at Article 6 of the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen: “Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.” Those are radical ideas, that the laws come from citizens, not from kings or gods, and that those laws should apply to everyone equally. That’s a long way from Hammurabi - and in truth, it’s a long way from the slaveholding Thomas Jefferson. In the 1970s, Chinese President Zhou Enlai was asked what the affects of the French Revolution had been. And he said, “It’s too soon to say.” And in a way, it still is. The French Revolution asked new questions about the nature of people’s rights and the derivation of those rights. And we’re still answering those questions and sorting through how our answers should shape society today - must government be of the people to be for the people? Do our rights derive from nature or from God or from neither? And what are those rights? As William Faulkner said, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” Thanks for watching.

Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as","The French Revolution, beginning in 1789, was fueled by economic crisis, widespread hunger, and an unfair social system where the wealthy nobility and clergy paid no taxes. King Louis XVI's failure to reform the financial system led to national bankruptcy, and his attempts to quell unrest with military force provoked revolutionary action. The National Assembly abolished feudal rights, declared the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, and briefly established a constitutional monarchy before radical factions, like the Jacobins, escalated violence. After the execution of Louis XVI, the Reign of Terror ensued, with thousands guillotined. Despite initial ideals, the revolution culminated in the rise of Napoleon, marking the end of France's brief republican experiment and a return to authoritarian rule, though with constitutional changes. The revolution's legacy is controversial, highlighting questions about rights, state power, and governance that remain relevant today."
"(soft music) - [Narrator] The first thing the farmer notices is the smell, an earthy wrought in the fields. The Irishman walks into his potato field to find the plants turning brown and wilting. He digs up a tuber and finds it slimy like a bar of soap. When he slices it open, brown mucus oozes out. The whole crop is the same. It'll be a hungry year, but he will survive because this isn't Ireland in the famine year of 1845. It's the United States two years earlier, and this man has no idea how this blight will devastate the country of his birth.

To learn how you can vote on the shows we make, click the link below. (soft music) The Irish Potato Famine ranks as one of Europe's worst agricultural disasters. An event so momentous that it not only defined a generation, its scattered a people to the winds. When the blight arrived in 1845, Ireland had a population of 8.2 million. Within a decade, though, a third of it was gone. Around 1.1 million died from starvation and disease while 2 million emigrated abroad. Actually, you know what? Strike that. Emigration isn't the right word. It was flight, plain and simple, an evacuation. During the height of the famine years when children's mouths were stained green from eating grass and dogs scavenged graveyards, people brawled on the docks for space aboard the overcrowded vessels. Most didn't even care where the ship was headed as long as it wasn't Ireland. Yet Ireland was not the only country or even the first to experience the blight. The fungus responsible emerged in the United States in 1843, hitching a ride to Europe in cargo holds. Farmers attempting to strengthen European potato strains may have even accidentally imported it when they cross-bred their potatoes with American stock. And strengthened by a rainy summer and carried by the wind, the fungus stormed the continent. During the summer of 1845, news of the blight filled European newspapers. Belgium had lost 87% of its potato crop. Flanders 92, Holland lost 70%. Germany and France got off relatively light, only losing a fifth of their harvest. Rumors of starvation leaked out of Russia and Poland. While English farmers saw similar devastation. Governments prepared for a season of hunger and instability. The potato, after all, was the staple diet of Europe's emerging industrial working class. This miracle plant, imported from Peru, could produce two to four times more calories per acre than grain. Cheap and easy to prepare, it allowed Europe's shrinking agricultural sector to feed its booming manufacturing workforce. And between 1750 and 1850, the European population nearly doubled, partially due to the potato. Any threat to the potato crop was a serious problem. In fact, these crop failures would help spur the wave of revolutions that racked Europe in 1848, but here the story of Ireland diverges because while all these countries experienced economic hardship and social change, Ireland alone starved. The reasons for that are complicated, but they boil down to two factors. The first was a land system that made Ireland uniquely vulnerable to a crop failure, and the second factor was human. A group of British leaders governing from London, who saw the famine relief as a vehicle for reforming the Irish economy and instructing the people's moral character. Throughout the crisis, British policymakers would make economic reform their primary objective with saving lives as a distant secondary goal. The blight indeed was as British politicians argued, an act of God unstoppable and inevitable. The famine by contrast, was the work of men, but that was still to come. In the summer of 1845, British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, was tracking reports of blight. He worried about it striking England, of course, but he knew that if it took hold in Ireland, the result would be catastrophic. Technically, Ireland had been a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland since 1801. But in a practical sense, it had been the very first step in the British colonial empire. The English had ruled it directly or indirectly for centuries. In that time, the British crown had gradually dispossessed native Irish Catholic families, confiscating their land and gifting it to English and Scot's Protestants, who were considered more reliably loyal. While Catholic countries sponsored a series of Irish revolts against the Protestant English, and tensions grew. The climax came when Oliver Cromwell reconquered Ireland after a rebellion completing the process of land confiscation and totally replacing Irish landowners with English and Scots, the so-called 'Anglo-Irish,' and it was bloody. Conservative estimates suggest that Cromwell's invasion, along with the famine it caused, may have killed 10% of the Irish population. To prevent another uprising, Cromwell and later British governments passed a series of penal laws restricting Catholic rights. Catholics could not hold public office, own firearms or be admitted to the bar as lawyers. They couldn't own a horse worth over five pounds, vote, teach school or marry a Protestant. There were restrictions on how they could own land, and when willing land to children, they couldn't give it intact to the eldest and had to break it up equally among all their children. Churches couldn't be built of stone and had to sit far from roads, and they couldn't attend universities at home or abroad. And 80% of the Irish population was Catholic. These laws were designed to bar Irish Catholics from all forms of political and economic advancement. And while they were gradually repealed, the last vanishing in 1829, it would take generations for the Irish to recover economically. And on top of that, these landlords charged astronomical rent on the land, barely allowing the native Irish farmers to survive. And the whole thing took place in a system of middlemen so convoluted that... Okay, okay, here's an analogy. Imagine someone owns an apartment building today. That's the landowner. They don't wanna manage it, so they pass it off to a middle person to manage. Now the middle person wants to make a profit and knows there's a lot of demand, so they jack up the rent and to make more profits, they subdivide some of the larger apartments into smaller ones. Now, under the pressure of making this exorbitant rent, some of the buildings tenants start to get roommates or rent some of their bedrooms on Airbnb, further subdividing their own apartment. Wow, this sounds really familiar. Oh, hi, NYC. I didn't see you in this analogy. Anyway, that's basically what happened to Irish farmers. In fact, some of the landowners known as absentee landlords hadn't even lived in Ireland for generations. The trend was bad. Then events made it worse. During the Napoleonic Wars, Irish goods suddenly became a major part of British imports as the war cut off suppliers in France. Things improved for the Irish with many turning to new manufacturing jobs. But then Napoleon was defeated, French goods returned and the burgeoning industrial sector collapsed. Out of work weavers and tradesmen flooded the countryside, engaging in ludicrous bidding wars for small plots of farmland promising to pay rents the land could never sustain. Irish farmers began cultivating land that had never been farmed before. Rocky hillsides, beaches and bogs. The land, subdivided already through the inheritance laws and the greed of landowners got subdivided further. And middlemen for those landlords, increasingly disappointed with returns from potato farmers, evicted whole villages to use the land for cattle raising, which squeezed the farmers even further. By 1841, 45% of all agricultural holdings were under five acres. A consequence of population explosion paired with a land system that depended on chains of landlords, often three or four deep leading back to England. Only one thing allowed people to survive. You guessed it, the potato. A single acre of potato plants could produce six tons of crop per year, enough to feed a family of six. No other crop provided such a yield, but many Irish families were larger than that, and the rent still had to be paid. In the decades leading up to the famine, the shrinking plots of land gave most no more than a subsistence living. Ireland was already the poorest country in Europe. Before the subdivision, most families at least had a cow. But in the decades before the famine, the more expensive cow disappeared, replaced by a pig. Milk, butter, eggs, and herring disappeared from the peasants diets. Cash crops like barley and oats vanished, replaced by more potatoes. Visitors were shocked at the depth of Irish poverty. The majority of the country went shoeless, and many in the countryside wore literal rags. In towns, landless workers lived by the pawn shop, pawning their Sunday clothes after attending church, buying them back on Friday payday, wearing them to church again, and then repeating the cycle. But those same visitors were often astounded by the peasants hardiness. Irish peasants were strong and often good looking. Scientific testing, so popular in the Victorian age found that the average Irish peasant was both taller and stronger than both English and Belgian ones. And it was due to their diet. Eating nutritious, vitamin filled potatoes, three meals a day. But in August of 1845, Irish farmers walked into their fields and smelled rot. The blight was in Ireland, but London had a plan to use this crisis to remake Ireland. A plan that would bring down Prime Minister Peel. (soft music) London, September 12th, 1845. The press operator runs off issues of the Gardeners' Chronicle. Over 6,000 copies, fresh and ready for tomorrow. The editor bursts in waving a piece of paper. They must stop the presses and insert a front page notice. No, it can't wait until next week. 'The potato blight has reached Ireland,' the notice reads. Crops around Dublin are perishing. It ends with a question. Where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot? But everyone knows where it will be, in the embrace of hunger. Two months later, the Gardeners' Chronicle was in the minority when it predicted agricultural disaster. Over the past two months, the press sent mixed signals. Some said the potato crop was fine, others that the blight only affected a few counties. So to get a sense of the problem, Prime Minister Robert Peel sent a scientific commission to get solid numbers. Wait, pause the history for just a second. The prime minister's name during the potato famine was Peel. No one else thinks that's a little funny? No, no, I know it's a serious story. Come on, stop looking at me like. Fine, you know what it's fine, it's fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. His name's Peel though. Now that commission was in the House of Commons telling Parliament to expect 80% mortality in the potato crop. They'd devised methods for keeping the blight away from harvested potatoes. But these proved ineffective. The news, troubled Peel. In the summer, there had been hints of crop loss, but that was nothing new. Irish potatoes were unreliable. There had been 16 potato failures since 1800. And when crops failed, tenants couldn't pay their rent. When tenants didn't pay, landlords brought police and troops to throw them off their land. That meant riots and retaliatory livestock killings. It would also mean secret societies like the Molly Maguires and Whiteboys ambushing landlords and middlemen in their carriages. And those previous potato losses were only regional. This was the whole island. Instability worried Peel. A few years before the Irish member of Parliament, Daniel O'Connell, who had campaigned successfully against anti-Catholic laws, had set his sights on repealing the Act of Union. O'Connell's outdoor meetings had attracted half a million people, and the government had to threaten force to disperse them. Since then, Peel had taken a more conciliatory approach, but famine could upend everything. And the reports were bad. Now that it was November and the full harvests were coming in, the scope of the problem was becoming clear. Not even harvested potatoes were safe. In western Ireland, a poor farmer had buried his harvested potatoes in a pit, muttering a prayer at how lucky he'd been, no blight. But a few days later, he opened the pit to check them. Half were totally rotten. Panic struck the whole west of Ireland where the climate was too wet for grain or oats. 'I cannot describe in language strong enough,' read one account. 'The frightful and awful alarm of the poor people. May God, in his bountiful mercy avert such a disastrous calamity.' Peel had his faults, but inaction was not one of them. The son of a textile industrialist, he was the first prime minister to come from business rather than the aristocracy. He'd risen through the civil service with sheer hard work and a few big gambles, and he was about to gamble again. Ireland would need food, but Peel would have to walk a fine line. He was a Tory and his conservative party were hardcore trade protectionists, particularly due to support from grain merchants. Whatever he did, it couldn't undercut or upset the grain market. And then there was the opposition, the liberal Whigs. They were similarly hardcore when it came to free trade economics. They hated any government intervention in the market. So in other words, the Tories wouldn't support bringing in foreign grain because it would cut local merchants profits and the Whigs would shoot down any intervention on price. Meanwhile, Daniel O'Connell and a Dublin group proposed their own measures. Forbid turning grain into whiskey, bring in foreign grains, institute public works, and stop exporting Irish grain beef and oats to England. Neither party Peel knew would stand for that. After all, grain imports were already a sensitive split. As the two parties consistently brawled over the corn laws, a series of protectionist measures meant to keep cheap American grain out of the UK. Oh, by the way, in Britain, corn means grain. Got it? Cool. Peel had a plan to thread the needle, but it had to stay a secret. He sent an agent to Boston on a mission to buy a hundred thousand pounds worth of maize or cornmeal. Peel's agents then started shipping it to Ireland on the quiet. His bet was this, since maize didn't grow in Britain and no British merchants traded in it, this wouldn't be a direct intervention in the market. But the shipments still had to be kept secret, or British merchants might freak out about the competition and withhold their shipments to Ireland.","In 1845, the potato blight reached Ireland, causing widespread crop failure that led to mass starvation and emigration. While other European countries were affected, Ireland's unique socio-economic conditions, including a colonial land system, made it especially vulnerable. Irish farmers, largely dependent on potatoes for subsistence, faced eviction from absentee landlords, worsening poverty, and deteriorating living conditions. The British government, led by Prime Minister Robert Peel, was aware of the impending disaster but struggled with political and economic pressures, balancing between trade protectionism and the need for foreign aid. Despite opposition, Peel secretly arranged for the import of cornmeal to alleviate the crisis, but his plan faced significant challenges."

(At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly","The video humorously recounts the events leading to the French Revolution, starting with the lavish lifestyles of the French aristocracy, including King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, while the country faced severe financial crisis. Louis XVI, a weak ruler, escalated the debt by financing the American Revolution, and his ineffective responses to economic hardship fueled unrest among the poor. The monarchy's lavish spending, especially by Marie Antoinette, worsened public opinion, with taxes being heavily imposed on the peasants. Amid widespread poverty, famine, and inequality, the Third Estate grew increasingly disillusioned and formed the National Assembly, demanding reform. Tensions escalated, and after rumors of royal military intervention, the Parisian populace stormed the Bastille in 1789, marking the start of the revolution."

I wonder who it could be? Ancient China. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, the children are playing in the village square. 'What a wonderful time to be alive! Hey, the Yellow River flooded again and destroyed all your crops. aaand also we're being raided by nomadic tribesmen, aaaand also this period of Chinese history may be entirely mythical, meaning you may not even exist. Well, that would certainly explain the laser eyes. Chinese civilization began around the year 2000 BC, when the (possibly mythical) Xia dynasty was formed. Throughout China's history, dynasties would usually rise up with a powerful leader who worked for the good of the people. But over time, the leaders would become more corrupt and self-serving. Someone would inevitably build a lake of alcohol and the angry populace would overthrow them, giving way for a new dynasty to rise. Following this pattern, the Xia dynasty was replaced by the Shang, who liked bronze and writing. But then the leaders got corrupt and were replaced by the Zhou, who liked the iron and philosophy. But that one sort of just fell apart and was replaced by the Qin, who liked building walls and people made out of rock. But they were pretty tyrannical from the start, and were quickly replaced by the Han, who liked creating new trade routes and getting in touch with their emotions. In line with this pattern, the Han dynasty came about under the strong and popular leadership of Emperor Gaozu. The dynasty remained firmly in place for over four centuries, and was considered a golden age in Chinese history, developing new forms of art, political thinking, technology... Oh, looks like all the leaders got corrupt. See, probably the biggest problem in ancient China's political system that allowed so much corruption to come about all the time was a little something called Court Culture. Let me explain. Imagine for me, if you will, that you are the son of the Chinese emperor. Hooray! Now apart from how weird it is that you have a ton of stepmoms and many of them would like to kill you, and also all of your friends are middle-aged dudes with no dongs, life's pretty alright. One day your father says, 'Son, I know our relationship hasn't been the best, and I've never said this before but I just want to let you know that I love y- Oh no! I'm having a heart attack!' (oof) Look at you. Now YOU're the Emperor. I'm so proud of you. But wait! You are but a child and have no idea how to rule over a massive empire? Fret not! Because just about everyone in your court wants to help you out with that. 'Hey, man, remember me? I'm your mom's bro. Anyway, I heard you needed someone to rule over China for you. I mean to help you rule China. So hey, here's a popsicle. I hope we can get along.' 'No way m an. We've been your friends and your personal caretakers your whole life, and even though we may have no dongs, I think you should give US all the power to rule China. I mean, help you rule China.' So who will you be influenced by? Your scheming uncle, or your loyal eunuchs? And towards the end of the Han dynasty, a string of child emperors allowed more and more power to fall into the hands of the eunuchs. Oh no! Now they're scheming too! They began handing out government jobs for bribes, heavily taxing the poor for their own wealth, and while you're sitting there eating your popsicle, everyone in your court is literally murdering each other to try and consolidate more power and riches for themselves, while all the peasants are outside like: 'Hey, did you guys know there's been a drought out here for two years?' 'Guys?' Obviously, the people weren't too happy that while they were struggling to survive, they're also been heavily taxed, so that the eunuch faction could all have rocking mansions, complete with swimming pools and Alexas. So finally, when a self-proclaimed Taoist wizard came along and was like, 'You know whose fault it is that we're all out here starving? It's the Emperor and his posse! They've lost their mandate from heaven and the imperial family must be DESTROYED with an UNRELENTING, FURIOUS WRATH!!! Also check this out. Eh? Can you tell what it is yet? Tada! It's a little kitty-cat!' 'Look at her little ears!' The people loved his political philosophy. He promised them land reforms and his followers grew in number. They began arming themselves and wearing yellow turbans, and they also developed a really catchy slogan. In the year 184, the Yellow Turban rebellion broke out across China, with millions rising up against the Han dynasty and the imperial government in the capital city freaked out. With all their internal bickering, they were completely unprepared and unable to deal with such a huge rebellion. So they were forced to call in independent warlords from across the Empire to help them deal with this situation. Some big names took part in the fighting, I'm talking the likes of the great Cao Cao, the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, Liu Bei, Sun Jian, and many many other Chinese names I'm definitely not pronouncing correctly. These warlords crushed the rebellion in their own respective regions, and with casualties in the millions, the Han dynasty breathed a huge sigh of relief. But what they didn't realize, is that by relying on all the warlords and their armies, they had essentially diminished their own central control over the empire and many of the warlords now held the power to act almost completely independently and rule over their own local regions themselves. Back in the capital, the Emperor and his son were having a little chat. 'Listen, I know we've had our ups and downs, and I spent all of my time with your many, MANY smokin' hot stepmoms instead of you. But what say you and I finally go on a little fishing trip together this weeke- Oh NO, I'm having a stroke-' (oof) and yet another child emperor was on the throne. This time, however, instead of the eunuch faction gaining even more power, this Child Emperor's uncle became his regent, who also just so happened to be the head of the Imperial Army, He Jin. 'Man, 'Man, I hate those sneaky lying cheating eunuchs. Hey warlord, Yuan Shao. What should we do?' 'Kill them all.' [Silence] 'Right on.' 'You can't kill the eunuchs! They're a vital part of this Empire's governance! And also they paid me a lot of money to say that about them.' 'Aw, c'mooon!' 'No.' So He Jin and Yuan Shao decided the Empress may need more convincing, and so they called in an infamous, and so they called in an infamous, feared and so they called in an infamous, feared, tyrannical, overweight warlord from the Northwest to help convince her. That man, was Dong Zhuo. And he set out for the capital city with his army. 'Hey guys, I heard a rumor that He Jin was planning on killing us.' 'Then why don't we kill him first!' And so it was. They lured him to the palace with a forged letter from his sister and when he got there, they lobbed off his head. [Slice sounds] [Silence] 'Kill them all.' Imperial Forces stormed the palace and the eunuchs were all massacred. The peasants, who were still suffering from drought and starvation, saw what was going on and began to riot. The Emperor and his brother were forced to flee the city, which was now in flames. And the feared, nasty, tyrannical, bloated Dong Zhuo had just arrived. He found the Emperor and his brother wandering the hills outside of the city and was understandably confused, so he scooped up the Emperor, went to the capital and was like, 'Hey guys, what's up? I see the capital is on fire.' 'Also, I'm here with my army and I have the Emperor with me.' 'Waaaait a minute! The capital is on fire. I'm here with my army and I have the Emperor! Screw you guys! I'M IN CHARGE!' So now Dong Zhuo ruled over the Han dynasty as the Emperor's Regent. His first act was to say to the Emperor, 'Hey man, no hard feelings, but I like your little brother better. So I'm actually making him Emperor instead of you.' 'So you're free to go do whatever you want.' 'Actually...' 'Yeah, that feels better.' Dong Zhuo ruled with an iron fist. And he did whatever the flip he wanted. He made absolute decisions himself, showing no regard for the monarchy. He had his opponents or those who disagreed with him killed. He broke protocol, doing things like keeping his sword when approaching the Emperor, [Gasp sounds] wearing shoes in the court, [More gasp sounds] sleeping in the Emperor's bed. And worst of all, he would walk in the presence of the Emperor. You were meant to TROT. The other warlords around the Empire hated him, and so they said, 'Something needs to be done about this guy. What say we form a coalition and oust him?' And it was agreed. Warlords from across China, their armies amounting to a hundred thousand men, allied together against the tyranny of Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao's coalition consisted of some of the nation's most capable leaders, including his half-brother Yuan Shu, the great Cao Cao and Sun Jian. But Dong Zhuo had an ace up his sleeve. His protégé, and adopted son, one of the most skilled and feared warriors in all of China. It's Lu Bu! This guy was a beast of a man. He never lost a duel and no other warlord dared challenge him to one. He was also famous for betraying just about every warlord he ever fought for, something that Dong Zhuo didn't seem too concerned about. The coalition attacked Dong Zhuo in Luoyang, and in particular, Sun Jian's forces inflicted a heavy defeat against him, and he was forced to flee to the city of Chang'an. After this initial success, however, the war entered into a stalemate. The warlords in the coalition realized it was going nowhere, and also they all secretly hated each other, so they all went home. Dong Zhuo was safe. Until... Legend has it that a government official in Chang'an had a daughter who was hot. SUPER hot. He invited Lu Bu to his home and promised Lu Bu that someday he could marry his daughter. Then he invited Dong Zhuo to his house and did the exact same thing. Dong Zhuo was so smitten that he insisted on taking her as his concubine immediately, and when Lu Bu heard the news, he was pretty unhappy. 'Hey man, aren't you worried that you stole Lu Bu's girl, and betrayal is like his personal hobby.' 'Lu Bu? Betray me? No way, man. Never gonna happen-' Aw crap. Lu Bu, along with other government officials, assassinated the tyrannical Dong Zhuo. Then they left his body burning in the streets. Some sources say he was so fat and oily he kept on burning for days. Nice. So with Dong Zhuo dead, and the power of the Han government essentially decimated, China was left with a huge power gap, and a ton of warlords who all slept soundly at night dreaming of being the one to fill it. Here we enter into a crazy and chaotic period of civil war all across China, with so many people, so much betrayal, so much intricacy, it makes Game of Thrones look like a Dr. Seuss publication. But just to give you an idea of how crazy and chaotic it was, see if you're able to keep up with this. Are you ready? Here we go. Here's a rough map of the warlords throughout the Han dynasty at the time. Half-brothers Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu were both in a power struggle for who had become the figurehead of their family. Yuan Shu made alliances with warlords in the north, along with Sun Jian, the guy who defeated Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao also made alliances, with Liu Biao in the south, and Cao Cao, who was an amazing strategist and general. All of these warlords began fighting each other, Cao Cao began building his own strength by subjugating nearby remnants of the Yellow Turban rebellion into his own forces. Down south, things weren't going so well for Sin Jian, as he was killed in an ambush. So Sun's son, Sun Ce, took over. Then, Yuan Shao got pushed back to the river Hwai. So he ordered Sun Ce to take the territory of warlord Liu Kang. Then, Sin Ce went off to capture territories in the east for himself. Cao Cao's family lived in this province over here. One day, they were murdered. Oh no, Cao Cao held the province's governor responsible, and so he launched a cruel invasion, in which he pillaged cities and murdered over a hundred thousand civilians. The governor sent out a call for help, and a very popular likeable warlord by the name of Liu Bei came to his aid. However, while Cao Cao was away fighting, a rebellion was staged against him in his home province, by none other than, it's Lu Bu. Cao Cao rushed home and defeated Lu Bu, who fled to the east, which by now had been inherited by Liu Bei. Then Lu Bu, surprise surprise, launched a rebellion against Liu Bei, who fled to Cao Cao. Cao Cao and Liu Bei would go on to invade and defeat Lu Bu. Lu Bu offered to join Cao Cao and Cao Cao considered the offer, but his advisors were like, 'No way, man This guy's betrayed literally everyone he ever worked for.' And so, boo hoo, Lu Bu was executed. Next, Cao Cao convinced the Emperor to move in with him. Now he's in control of the Han government, something that made his allies very jealous. Yuan Shu, out of nowhere, decides to declare himself emperor of the new Zhong dynasty. Nobody liked that. His allies cut ties with him, the Imperial Government ordered everyone to kill him, he tried to flee to his brother Yuan Shou, but died of illness on the way. Sun Ce took over his territory and then got assassinated, so his brother Sun Quan took over. Liu Bei turned on Cao Cao, but got obliterated and was forced to flee south Yuan Shao finally defeated the warlord to his north, and could now focus south. He declared war on","The video discusses the rise and fall of various dynasties in ancient China, starting with the Xia dynasty, highlighting the recurring pattern of powerful leaders becoming corrupt, leading to their overthrow and the establishment of new dynasties. It focuses on the Han dynasty, which enjoyed a golden age but eventually succumbed to corruption, with eunuchs gaining too much power, leading to widespread unrest. The Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in 184 AD, weakening the Han. This period saw power struggles among warlords like Cao Cao, Dong Zhuo, and Liu Bei, culminating in constant betrayal, assassinations, and civil war, with multiple factions vying for control. The video highlights significant events like the assassination of Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu’s betrayals, and the ultimate downfall of several warlords."
"What rights do people have, and where do they come from? Who gets to make decisions for others and on what authority? And how can we organize society to meet people's needs? These questions challenged an entire nation during the upheaval of the French Revolution. By the end of the 18th century, Europe had undergone a profound intellectual and cultural shift known as the Enlightenment. Philosophers and artists promoted reason and human freedom over tradition and religion. The rise of a middle class and printed materials encouraged political awareness, and the American Revolution had turned a former English colony into an independent republic. Yet France, one of the largest and richest countries in Europe was still governed by an ancient regime of three rigid social classes called Estates. The monarch King Louis XVI based his authority on divine right and granted special privileges to the First and Second Estates, the Catholic clergy, and the nobles. The Third Estate, middle class merchants and craftsmen, as well as over 20 million peasants, had far less power and they were the only ones who paid taxes, not just to the king, but to the other Estates as well. In bad harvest years, taxation could leave peasants with almost nothing while the king and nobles lived lavishly on their extracted wealth. But as France sank into debt due to its support of the American Revolution and its long-running war with England, change was needed. King Louis appointed finance minister Jacques Necker, who pushed for tax reforms and won public support by openly publishing the government's finances. But the king's advisors strongly opposed these initiatives. Desperate for a solution, the king called a meeting of the Estates-General, an assembly of representatives from the Three Estates, for the first time in 175 years. Although the Third Estate represented 98% of the French population, its vote was equal to each of the other Estates. And unsurprisingly, both of the upper classes favored keeping their privileges. Realizing they couldn't get fair representation, the Third Estate broke off, declared themselves the National Assembly, and pledged to draft a new constitution with or without the other Estates. King Louis ordered the First and Second Estates to meet with the National Assembly, but he also dismissed Necker, his popular finance minister. In response, thousands of outraged Parisians joined with sympathetic soldiers to storm the Bastille prison, a symbol of royal power and a large storehouse of weapons. The Revolution had begun. As rebellion spread throughout the country, the feudal system was abolished. The Assembly's Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed a radical idea for the time -- that individual rights and freedoms were fundamental to human nature and government existed only to protect them. Their privileges gone, many nobles fled abroad, begging foreign rulers to invade France and restore order. And while Louis remained as the figurehead of the constitutional monarchy, he feared for his future. In 1791, he tried to flee the country but was caught. The attempted escape shattered people's faith in the king. The royal family was arrested and the king charged with treason. After a trial, the once-revered king was publicly beheaded, signaling the end of one thousand years of monarchy and finalizing the September 21st declaration of the first French republic, governed by the motto 'liberté, égalité, fraternité.' Nine months later, Queen Marie Antoinette, a foreigner long-mocked as 'Madame Déficit' for her extravagant reputation, was executed as well. But the Revolution would not end there. Some leaders, not content with just changing the government, sought to completely transform French society -- its religion, its street names, even its calendar. As multiple factions formed, the extremist Jacobins lead by Maximilien Robespierre launched a Reign of Terror to suppress the slightest dissent, executing over 20,000 people before the Jacobin's own downfall. Meanwhile, France found itself at war with neighboring monarchs seeking to strangle the Revolution before it spread. Amidst the chaos, a general named Napoleon Bonaparte took charge, becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend the Revolution's democratic values. All in all, the Revolution saw three constitutions and five governments within ten years, followed by decades alternating between monarchy and revolt before the next Republic formed in 1871. And while we celebrate the French Revolution's ideals, we still struggle with many of the same basic questions raised over two centuries ago.","The French Revolution was sparked by questions of rights, authority, and societal organization amid France's outdated social structure and mounting debt. The Enlightenment's ideas on reason and freedom clashed with France's rigid Estates system, where the Third Estate, representing 98% of the population, was unfairly taxed while the First and Second Estates held privileges. King Louis XVI's failed reforms and the subsequent calling of the Estates-General led to the National Assembly declaring a new constitution. The storming of the Bastille marked the start of a revolution that abolished feudalism, executed the king and queen, and proclaimed the first French republic. Extremist factions like the Jacobins led to the Reign of Terror, while Napoleon eventually rose to power, claiming to uphold revolutionary values. The revolution's legacy remains a complex interplay of democratic ideals and political turmoil."
"- [Narrator] King Louie and his family were now in the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where for the next couple of years, he watched as the revolutionary government began to strip away his power and fearing for his safety, he had to stay on their good side. Hey, look who it is. It's my favorite revolutionaries. Yep, I'm your number one fan. What can I do for you? Hey, King Louie. So we've made a few decisions. First, all of your friends in the nobility are gonna have to pay taxes the same as everyone else. Great idea. I love it. And as a side note, the tax money can no longer pay for all your lavish parties. Great, I hate those parties. They're so awkward. And also we're taking away your Porsche. Ah, come on. I mean, Yay. The king continually found demand after demand being made of him to prove his support for the revolution. On one occasion, a mob would invade the palace and demand he wear the revolutionary bonnet. This is the face of a man who is definitely pretending he wants to wear that bonnet. Now around here, I wanna mention that one thing King Louie had a problem with was people constantly raiding his palace, but one thing he didn't have a problem with was raiding noobs on this video's sponsor, Raid Shadow Legends.

Good luck and I'll see you there. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. Seeing the situation rapidly turning against him, the king decided it might be a good idea to leave France and mount a campaign to retake his country from abroad. Luckily for him, he was married to an Austrian. So on the night of June 20th, 1791, the king in his family disguised themselves as servants and attempted to flee to the Austrian Netherlands. The royal carriage made a stop in the town of Varennes and the postmaster there was like, 'hey guys, what's up? Where are you off to?' We are but a collection of inconspicuous servants heading for the border for no particular reason at all. Say, you, the fat one. You look kind of familiar. Aren't you the king? Nope. Let me see your passport. It says here, you're King Louis the 16th. Nope, not me. Take him away, boys. The King was promptly returned to Paris, but now the jig was up. His lack of support for the revolution was clear to all and many considered him a straight up traitor who tried to abandon his people. As a result, the new Constitution of 1791 completely reduced his powers to that of a simple figurehead, a constitutional monarch. However radicals, such as those in the Jacobin Club, were outraged that the king wasn't to be removed entirely. So a month later, these radicals staged a protest on the Champ de Mars calling for the king's removal. The government of Paris feared an insurrection was mounting and they sent the military to disperse the crowd. The confrontation escalated and resulted in the revolutionary National Guard firing on a crowd of revolutionaries. It was a massacre. The incident exposed a deep division within the brotherhood of the revolution. On one side, the moderates who wanted to keep the King as a figurehead, on the other radicals who wanted to see the king deposed and heads roll. In the wake of the massacre, these radicals received a wave of support. And speaking of rolling heads, one form of equality of the revolution introduced was a quality in execution. This meant no more torturous drawing and quartering, no more inhumane hanging. They wanted all criminals, regardless of economic status to receive the same penalty. A quick and painless one. Luckily, a man by the name of Dr. Joseph Guillotine had an idea. A heavy blade that falls like thunder. The head flies off, blood spurts, and the man is no more. The guillotine, otherwise known as the National Razor. The guillotine made its debut in 1791 as the new form of execution. The writings of Marat and others continued to call for the execution of anyone suspected of working against the revolution. For him, this included some members of the clergy and nobility who had previously benefited from the cruel system of inequality that existed before the revolution. In many parts of the countryside, local lords had found themselves become a target. Sire, the peasants, they're revolting. Oh, come on. That's a bit harsh. Sure, they smell a bit, but I wouldn't say they're revolting. Oh, yes, I see what you mean. Increasingly, these French aristocrats began fleeing France to find solitude in other parts of Europe. And once again, fear began to take hold. The privileged classes of these foreign nations didn't like what they were seeing because they feared revolutionary ideas may spread to their own lands. The National Assembly, actually now the Legislative Assembly feared that these nations may decide to attack. Then why don't we attack them first? No, you idiots. We are definitely not ready for war yet. Did somebody say something? France declared war in Austria in April, 1792 and immediately got pummeled. It also didn't help that Austria's ally, Prussia, joined in the fighting. The Prussian Duke of Brunswick posted a letter warning the revolutionaries that if anything happened to the King, he would burn Paris to the ground. The Duke's letter proved to be a massive success in inspiring the people of Paris to do the exact opposite of what he intended. They were enraged by the threat. And on the 10th of August, 1792, the tension in the city exploded and a mob stormed the king's palace. Fighting broke out between the revolutionaries and the king's Swiss guard with casualties in the 100s. King Louis fled and took refuge in the chamber of the legislative assembly where Robespierre and his radical Jacobins were gaining evermore power. Given the developing situation, the chamber decided to hold a vote. And in what some considered to be a second revolution, it was decided to suspend the monarchy entirely. King Louis the 16th was now just plain old Louis and he was sent to a prison cell where an eye could be kept on him. A month later, the newly established national convention officially declared the French Republic and society underwent a massive change. Enlightened ideas of democracy and equality were being implemented. But very quickly, these ideas seemed to become secondary to fear, paranoia and a thirst for blood. The new republic began working to violently remove any semblance of the old royalist regime. The church became a prime target. Priests who refused to take a oath to the revolution were deported or arrested. A new state-sponsored atheistic religion named the Cult of Reason was created as a replacement for the Catholic Church. Notre Dam, along with many other churches, had the religious treasures destroyed and were converted to temples of reason. Even the Christian calendar didn't survive, as a brand new revolutionary calendar was soon introduced. Hey honey, I'm home. Yeah, whatever jerk. Whoa, what's wrong with you? You forgot. Forgot what? Everything. This entire year, my birthday was on the third of Germinal. Our anniversary was the 12th of Thermidor and you promised that in Frimaire, we'd go on a romantic weekend trip to Venice. No, I said would do that in December. December hasn't been a thing for years. The government of Paris now under the control of the radical San-Culottes began rounding up suspected enemies of the revolution and sending them to prison in the 1000s. Naturally, a large number of those arrested were members of the clergy and aristocracy. As Francis foreign enemies continued to close in, panic spread. Georges Danton made impassioned calls for men to defend the republic and tens of 1000s of troops left Paris for the front lines. However, in their absence, Paris was left to its own devices. As enemy troops arrived in Verdun, the people of Paris feared that their crowded prisons were becoming a breeding ground for counterrevolutionary conspiracy. What would happen if the Prussians reached Paris and freed the aristocrats? Marat believed he knew what would happen. The aristocrats would enact their vengeance on the people. Fearing those they had already imprisoned, mobs descended on Paris's prisons. They broke in. And during the brutal September massacres, aristocrats, priests and others were tried and executed on the spot. Even women and children weren't spared. With over 1,600 victims, word of the massacre spread across Europe. One British newspaper wondered, are these the rights of men? Is this the liberty of human nature? But there was still one man in particular that Robespierre and his radicals really wanted to see executed. Austria and Prussia pledged that after they defeated France, they'd returned King Louis to the throne. Well checkmate Austria and Prussia because he can't return a man to the throne if he's already dead. Citizen Louis Capet was put on trial for treason. Obviously he was found guilty, but his punishment was less certain. Many moderates wanted to simply deport him. But Robespierre insisted the revolution could only live if the king was dead. A vote was held and by just one vote, Louis was sentenced to the guillotine. If you don't mind, I'd like to say a few words first. Gentlemen, I am innocent of everything of which I am accused... Wait, you're too loud. They can't hear me. Hang on, I haven't finished yet. Wait, dude. Uncool. In her prison cell, Marie Antoinette heard the guns fire signaling her husband's death. Before long, she would meet the same fate. Back on the war front, France defied all expectations, and actually managed to push the enemy back. But then more countries joined the coalition against France and it all went to pot again. What do we do? Conscript the masses. The National Convention introduced a conscription law with each regional department having to meet a certain quota of men for the army. However, not everyone was happy with this new law. You see, while Paris was definitely a hotbed for radical revolutionary fervor, some of the regions outside of Paris weren't quite so keen on the revolution. Some were largely still conservative, still supported the church and just didn't suffer from that much inequality before the revolution. So as the revolution turned increasingly violent and anti-Christian, many were outraged. Now they were being conscripted to fight for the new republic they hated. That was the last straw. Counterrevolutionary uprisings erupted in a number of regions across France. Some would last for years, such as in the Northwest where a large scale uprising was led by The Owls. Why were they called The Owls? Because their leader was named Jean Owl. Why was he called John Owl? Possibly because he could do a really good impression of an owl. Really? That's what we're going with? Owls? Just because this guy can do an impression of one? Hit him with it, Jean. Hoot, hoot. Yeah, okay. That's pretty good. The Chouanary uprising lasted all the way until 1800. In the summer of 1793, the southern city of Toulon invited the British Navy over for some tea and crumpets. And then they asked if they'd possibly like to stay and occupy the city. Being an important naval base, this was a heavy blow to the republic who sent a relatively unknown young captain by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte to help stage the siege of the city. Toulon was recaptured by France in the winter and for his service Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. The most infamous counterrevolution, however, occurred in the Vendee region. Throughout 1793, revolutionary forces clashed with the region's Catholic and royal army. The republic defeated the counterrevolution through cruel pacification. In particular, general Jean Baptist Carrier committed brutal atrocities. In one instance, he had 1000s of civilians, priests, women and children tied to ships, which were then sunk. Carrier would later be found guilty of war crimes and executed. Back in Paris, the government was still dominated by moderates. With the war going badly, revolts in the provinces and the economy getting worse, it seemed the government just wasn't doing a very good job. Radicals' fear for the safety of the revolution intensified and Marat even began calling for the moderates in the government to be executed. In return, the moderates called for the arrest of Marat. This led to a chain of events with the two sides in heated conflict. Robespierre declared the Jacobins to be be an insurrection and called on the people to arm themselves. It all ended on the 31st of May, 1793 with the National Convention surrounded by radical Sans-culottes and 29 moderate Girondin politicians arrested. From this moment on, the moderate ceased to be a political force. Robespierre and his radicals would be an almost total control of the government. And this brings us to the story of a woman named Charlotte Corday. Charlotte lived in the northwest city of Caen and like many in the area was horrified at the rapid radicalization and increasing violence of the revolution. And the man she blamed more than anyone was Jean Paul Marat. She wanted to bring peace back to France. And so she did something drastic. She traveled to Paris and told Marat she had a list of enemies for him to publish in his paper. Marat eagerly invited her in for a meeting. So where's that list of enemies you promised me? Here it is. Wait a minute. This isn't the list of enemies. It just says 'yippee ki yay mother...' (Marat screams) And just like that, Marat was no more. Charlotte was quickly arrested and sent to the guillotine. Her dream of restoring peace, however, died with her. Marat became a martyr. In temples of reason, symbols of the dead Marat became the new crucifix. In death, he became an even more powerful inspiration for the extreme levels of violence that were about to rip throughout the new republic. And that's right. Here comes the reign of terror. If you thought this revolution already sounds pretty violent, well you ain't seen nothing yet, son. The radicals were now in control and they believed not only was France surrounded by foreign enemies,","King Louis XVI and his family were confined to the Tuileries Palace as the revolutionary government stripped him of power, forcing him to comply with numerous demands, including taxation for the nobility. Fearing for his safety, he attempted to flee to Austria in 1791 but was caught, marking him as a traitor. In response to growing radical demands, the monarchy was abolished, and France declared itself a republic. Tensions between moderates and radicals escalated, leading to the September Massacres and the adoption of the guillotine as a standard execution method. Foreign wars and internal uprisings intensified, with radicals like Robespierre gaining control, promoting violent purges. The revolution became increasingly brutal, marked by atrocities like the September Massacres and executions, including that of King Louis XVI, culminating in the Reign of Terror."

Get your new character pins and Russian revolution merch, available now. Link down below. Hey Jimmy, it's the 1800s, an exciting time to be alive. Why don't you get out there and explore the world? Gee whiz mum, thanks. This place is amazing. Where am I? Why you're in France, my boy. Here we come up with wacky new ways of running a country. Liberty, egality, fraternity. Whoa! Welcome to the United Kingdom. Here, we invented the train. Alllllll aboard. Holy smokes. You're in a German factory, my friend. Here, we harness fire and coal to create all these sexy lederhosen. This is incredible. I can't wait to see where I'll end up next. Where am I? You're in Russia. Have I gone back in time? No, this is just how it is. Are you a farmer? Worse, technically, my landlord owns me which makes me a serf. I'm scared. You should be because I haven't eaten in four days and you look pretty tasty. Hey Jimmy, how were your travels? I hate you. (soft melodic music) Russia, in the 19th century. Feudal, underdeveloped and stuck in the past. While the rest of Europe had been modernizing and improving their citizen's lives. Russia's rulers were taking a different approach. My Lord, we're falling behind the rest of Europe. It's time to industrialize. Give the people rights and share your power. (loud bomb exploding) Russian Tsars had no time for pathetic ideas like liberty and modernization because they were too busy having the time of their lives while the serfs were breaking their backs in the fields, the Tsars held all the power and they didn't have to listen to anyone. Wanna run the country like a backwards feudal kingdom while the rest of your pack paces humanitarian and economically, go right ahead. Wanna keep the people on educated so they don't get any ideas? There's no one to stop you. Wanna keep exporting grain even when there's a massive famine causing hundreds of thousands to die? That is your God given right. While all of this was great for the Tsar. If you were literally anybody else, it probably sucked because Russia was falling behind. If they were to keep up with Europe they'd need a strong ruler with some big ideas. Oh, look here comes one now. Hey everyone, it's me Tsar Alexander the second and I've got some big news. I'm releasing you all from your serfdom. You're all free. (crow cheering loudly) Yep, I'm the best. Oh, there is one thing though. I spoke to your local lords and they weren't happy about losing all their free labor. So as a compromise, you're all gonna have to pay them back in near impossible amount of money for the next 49 years. Expect your lives to barely change. Okay, bye. Now, I know what you're thinking. This Tsar Alexander the second seems like a pretty cool guy. He's trying to reform the country and get Russia on the right path. Everyone must love this guy, right, wrong. Why does one man get to decide fate of everyone in the country? This whole system is dumped. Somebody should do something. Like what? Like kill the Tsar. You're gonna kill the Tsar? Well me, no, I'm busy. I was kind of hoping you'd do it, okay. See the people love me. They're throwing flowers, confetti and high-grade explosives. (bomb exploding loudly) Okay Nicholas, your grandfather has a mild case of being blown up by a terrorist and he's not looking too hot. So we're gonna go say our goodbyes, okay? No, it'll be too scary for him. Nonsense, it won't be scary at all. We're just gonna say a quick goodbye, ready? Boy, look at me. The people did this to me and one day, they'll do it to you! See it wasn't scary at all. So Alexander the second was dead, but luckily they had another Alexander lying around. Alexander the third and he felt his dad's reforms had weakened the Tsar's authority. Russia was massive. And as a result had many ethnic minorities. Non Russians more interested in their own cultural heritage than in loving me, isn't it great? So much beautiful culture and diversity in our great nation. (bomb exploding loudly) Alexander thought all these minorities should be a little more Russian and thereby loyal to him. So he repressed religious minorities. He repressed non Russians. He introduced the Okhrana. A secret police force that repressed anybody who thought having a Tsar was dumb. If Alexander the second was the great reformer Alexander the third was the great repressor. Now that's how you run a country. Hey dad. Oh great, it's my son Nicholas, who I like to call a girly girl because he's so weak and pathetic. When are you gonna grow up? You still look like a girly girl to me. But dad, I grew a beard. Yeah, an ugly girly girl beard. (crying loudly) If Nicholas was to one day be Tsar. He needed his dad to teach him how to run the country. But his dad instead suggested that Nicholas goes somewhere else. So Nicholas went to Japan, got an edgy dragon tattoo. Had his head sliced off by a policeman and then came home. Now, will you teach me how to rule? I suppose it's time. Okay, there's a lot you need to know before becoming Tsar, uh oh, what? I've got kidney inflammation. Oh no. Upon his father's death, a totally unprepared Nicholas the second ascended to the Russian throne. He wasn't a reformer like his grandfather nor was he a repressor like his dad. Nicholas was Nicholas. Timid, easily swayed and more interested in doing whatever the hell this is or this or this. He wasn't ready to rule. And he himself admitted it saying I'm not yet ready to be Tsar. I know nothing of the business of ruling. Bit of an awkward time to bring it up. However, Nicholas firmly believed that he was chosen by God to be Russia's big daddy. And while he doubted his ability to rule, he was gonna give it his best shot. And hey, who knows? Maybe he wouldn't be so bad after all. To get things off to a good start. Nicholas promised free pretzels and beer to a huge crowd in Moscow to celebrate his coronation. So enticing a proposition to starving peasants that the ensuing stampede left nearly 1500 people dead. What the hell happened? We're not sure, but you're scheduled to go party with the French at eight o'clock. Shouldn't I stay here out of respect for the people? When have Russian Tsars ever respected the people? (upbeat music) Nicholas's decision to go party with the French immediately tarnished his image. Some were calling him Nicholas the bloody. The Tsars had been partying hard at the expense of the people for long enough that emancipated the serfs but failed to lift them out of poverty. They used their secret police to crack down on anyone who might criticize them and they had failed to modernize and give the people rights. Something the rest of Europe had begun doing over a century ago. The rule of the Tsars was quickly becoming outdated and more and more Russians began wondering if there was a better way. For many, the solution was simple. Just look to the West, republics, democracies and constitutional monarchies galore. But a small growing group rejected that for an even better idea, a little something they called communism. Take Vladimir Lenin a intelligent member of Russia's middle-class and also a massive ill tempered jerk. If you disagreed with him about anything he wasn't afraid to call you out. You fat headed simple-minded vapid cockeyed imbecile Tenderheart Bear is a far superior care bear to Bedtime Bear. (crying loudly) And he was no stranger to political unrest either. His older brother was executed for plotting to kill the Tsar and Lenin himself was expelled from university for participating in a student protest. But how did Lenin go from being a middle-class nerd to the arbiter of socialist divinity? Well, to tell that story, we first need to go back a few decades to when a man named Karl Marx, wrote a manifesto explaining how capitalism is a system where by the stinky British oppressed and exploded the working masses and that only through class warfare, could the workers rise up and enstate a communist utopia. Now go back forward a few decades to Lenin reading that manifesto and loving it. But publicly admitting you loved Marx and not Russia's big daddy would get you the cruelest punishment imaginable, exile to Siberia. Enjoy exile where you'll live with your wife chill around town and secretly write socialists newspapers. Hey, that doesn't sound so bad. And your mother-in-law's going to live with you, no! Once Lenin finished his stint in Siberia. He left Russia for Europe where he was free to hang out with other Russian Marxists and talk about how great communism was. Now today, you might hear the word communism and think of this. (dramatic orchestral music) But that's not how intellectuals living under a Tsarist regime saw it. To them, communism promised the land where all were equal, where workers weren't exploited and even people like you could get a girlfriend. So Lenin joined a party of Russian communists living in Europe and he founded a communist newsletter that was smuggled into Russia to try to radicalize the people. However, not everyone in the socialist party agreed with Lenin. In fact, they disagreed with him on a lot of issues and Lenin was so uncompromising that he caused a split in the party. During one conference, a heated debate broke out and Lenin was unwilling to give an inch. You pig ignorant, half witted fatuous morons, cereal is a soup. Listen, Lenin, you're a smart guy, but you have no idea what you're talking about. We're out of here. All in favor of cereal being a soup. Hey, would you look at that, we're in the majority. So Lenin set up his own faction within the party. He called the Majority or Bolshevik if you're speaking Russian and the other faction became known as the Minority or Menshevik. And oddly, the majority were often in the Minority and the minority in the Majority. The Mensheviks were less radical. Whereas Lenin wanted the Bolsheviks to be loyal to him and his uncompromising ideas. And if you weren't loyal well then you're gonna get a big brain beat down. Mensheviks worried that Lenin's attitude could lead to a one-man dictatorship, but come up, does this guy look like a dictator to you? For now Lenin remained in Europe, writing his socialist newspaper and impatiently awaiting an opportunity to overthrow the Tsar and bring communist utopia to Russia. Cool, a free hat.

Oh yeah, a timid easily swayed Tsar, a massive ill tempered jerk impatiently awaiting a communist revolution. And revolution was coming, but not in the way Lenin thought. Back in St. Petersburg. One of the Tsar's most skilled and influential advisors knew the country finally needed to catch up with the rest of Europe. Hey Nick, we really got to industrialize. Get more factories and make some I don't know, textiles or something. Won't that change the social fabric of Russia? Maybe, hey isn't it past your bedtime? But I haven't had my milk and snuggles yet. Will you snuggle me? Nicholas thought modernization was boring. But he let Sergei do his thing and do his thing he did. He borrowed some money and got Russia some sexy factories. And you know what sexy factories means, sexy workers, dirt poor, sexy workers. Long hours, low wages, filthy disease-ridden factories, sleep in over crowded dormitories with all your stinky worker friends. Get your arms ripped off in a freak Russian dole accident conditions were terrible. But this growing working class wasn't about to take it lying down. They started to do what workers do best, strike. Despite Sergei's efforts, people in Russia still weren't happy. Peasants were still poor, liberals still wanted reform. And now the workers wanted better working conditions. And the problem with being an autocrat is that when everyone's unhappy there's only person to blame, you. The people hate me, what do I do? Ooh, I know, why don't we find a weak and pathetic nation to go to war with. We'll win easily and everyone will love me again. Why don't we just try treating the people better? As luck would have it. An opportunity for war was forming in the far East. Russia wanted to expand its sphere of influence into Northern China and coincidentally, so did Japan. But Japan didn't really want war. So they proposed an idea to reduce the tension. Hey man, we'll let you do your thing in Manchuria. If you let us do our thing in Korea. I don't think so. We've got the largest army in the world, what do you have? I'm the Emperor of Japan, I have a giant Mecha suit. Whoa, cool. Nicholas and the boys didn't see Japan as a threat. So they felt they could push Japan around. But little did they know Japan had been rapidly militarizing. And when they launched a surprise attack on a Russian fleet at Port Arthur, everyone was shocked. Nicholas hoped it was an opportunity to win a quick war and regain the support of the people. Nobody seriously thought a puny Asian country could defeat a European superpower. And the","In 19th-century Russia, while Europe modernized, the Tsars continued to maintain absolute power, with Tsar Alexander II freeing the serfs but imposing heavy debts on them, and his successors, including Alexander III, enforcing repression. Tsar Nicholas II, unprepared and weak, ascended the throne, failed to modernize Russia, and faced growing unrest, culminating in his disastrous handling of public protests. Meanwhile, Vladimir Lenin, inspired by Marxism, advocated for communism and led the Bolshevik faction after splitting with the Mensheviks. Despite attempts to industrialize, the poor conditions for workers led to strikes, and Nicholas's decision to go to war with Japan in the Russo-Japanese War backfired, exacerbating his unpopularity."
"- [Narrator] King Louie and his family were now in the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where for the next couple of years, he watched as the revolutionary government began to strip away his power and fearing for his safety, he had to stay on their good side. Hey, look who it is. It's my favorite revolutionaries. Yep, I'm your number one fan. What can I do for you? Hey, King Louie. So we've made a few decisions. First, all of your friends in the nobility are gonna have to pay taxes the same as everyone else. Great idea. I love it. And as a side note, the tax money can no longer pay for all your lavish parties. Great, I hate those parties. They're so awkward. And also we're taking away your Porsche. Ah, come on. I mean, Yay. The king continually found demand after demand being made of him to prove his support for the revolution. On one occasion, a mob would invade the palace and demand he wear the revolutionary bonnet. This is the face of a man who is definitely pretending he wants to wear that bonnet. Now around here, I wanna mention that one thing King Louie had a problem with was people constantly raiding his palace, but one thing he didn't have a problem with was raiding noobs on this video's sponsor, Raid Shadow Legends.

Good luck and I'll see you there. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. Seeing the situation rapidly turning against him, the king decided it might be a good idea to leave France and mount a campaign to retake his country from abroad. Luckily for him, he was married to an Austrian. So on the night of June 20th, 1791, the king in his family disguised themselves as servants and attempted to flee to the Austrian Netherlands. The royal carriage made a stop in the town of Varennes and the postmaster there was like, 'hey guys, what's up? Where are you off to?' We are but a collection of inconspicuous servants heading for the border for no particular reason at all. Say, you, the fat one. You look kind of familiar. Aren't you the king? Nope. Let me see your passport. It says here, you're King Louis the 16th. Nope, not me. Take him away, boys. The King was promptly returned to Paris, but now the jig was up. His lack of support for the revolution was clear to all and many considered him a straight up traitor who tried to abandon his people. As a result, the new Constitution of 1791 completely reduced his powers to that of a simple figurehead, a constitutional monarch. However radicals, such as those in the Jacobin Club, were outraged that the king wasn't to be removed entirely. So a month later, these radicals staged a protest on the Champ de Mars calling for the king's removal. The government of Paris feared an insurrection was mounting and they sent the military to disperse the crowd. The confrontation escalated and resulted in the revolutionary National Guard firing on a crowd of revolutionaries. It was a massacre. The incident exposed a deep division within the brotherhood of the revolution. On one side, the moderates who wanted to keep the King as a figurehead, on the other radicals who wanted to see the king deposed and heads roll. In the wake of the massacre, these radicals received a wave of support. And speaking of rolling heads, one form of equality of the revolution introduced was a quality in execution. This meant no more torturous drawing and quartering, no more inhumane hanging. They wanted all criminals, regardless of economic status to receive the same penalty. A quick and painless one. Luckily, a man by the name of Dr. Joseph Guillotine had an idea. A heavy blade that falls like thunder. The head flies off, blood spurts, and the man is no more. The guillotine, otherwise known as the National Razor. The guillotine made its debut in 1791 as the new form of execution. The writings of Marat and others continued to call for the execution of anyone suspected of working against the revolution. For him, this included some members of the clergy and nobility who had previously benefited from the cruel system of inequality that existed before the revolution. In many parts of the countryside, local lords had found themselves become a target. Sire, the peasants, they're revolting. Oh, come on. That's a bit harsh. Sure, they smell a bit, but I wouldn't say they're revolting. Oh, yes, I see what you mean. Increasingly, these French aristocrats began fleeing France to find solitude in other parts of Europe. And once again, fear began to take hold. The privileged classes of these foreign nations didn't like what they were seeing because they feared revolutionary ideas may spread to their own lands. The National Assembly, actually now the Legislative Assembly feared that these nations may decide to attack. Then why don't we attack them first? No, you idiots. We are definitely not ready for war yet. Did somebody say something? France declared war in Austria in April, 1792 and immediately got pummeled. It also didn't help that Austria's ally, Prussia, joined in the fighting. The Prussian Duke of Brunswick posted a letter warning the revolutionaries that if anything happened to the King, he would burn Paris to the ground. The Duke's letter proved to be a massive success in inspiring the people of Paris to do the exact opposite of what he intended. They were enraged by the threat. And on the 10th of August, 1792, the tension in the city exploded and a mob stormed the king's palace. Fighting broke out between the revolutionaries and the king's Swiss guard with casualties in the 100s. King Louis fled and took refuge in the chamber of the legislative assembly where Robespierre and his radical Jacobins were gaining evermore power. Given the developing situation, the chamber decided to hold a vote. And in what some considered to be a second revolution, it was decided to suspend the monarchy entirely. King Louis the 16th was now just plain old Louis and he was sent to a prison cell where an eye could be kept on him. A month later, the newly established national convention officially declared the French Republic and society underwent a massive change. Enlightened ideas of democracy and equality were being implemented. But very quickly, these ideas seemed to become secondary to fear, paranoia and a thirst for blood. The new republic began working to violently remove any semblance of the old royalist regime. The church became a prime target. Priests who refused to take a oath to the revolution were deported or arrested. A new state-sponsored atheistic religion named the Cult of Reason was created as a replacement for the Catholic Church. Notre Dam, along with many other churches, had the religious treasures destroyed and were converted to temples of reason. Even the Christian calendar didn't survive, as a brand new revolutionary calendar was soon introduced. Hey honey, I'm home. Yeah, whatever jerk. Whoa, what's wrong with you? You forgot. Forgot what? Everything. This entire year, my birthday was on the third of Germinal. Our anniversary was the 12th of Thermidor and you promised that in Frimaire, we'd go on a romantic weekend trip to Venice. No, I said would do that in December. December hasn't been a thing for years. The government of Paris now under the control of the radical San-Culottes began rounding up suspected enemies of the revolution and sending them to prison in the 1000s. Naturally, a large number of those arrested were members of the clergy and aristocracy. As Francis foreign enemies continued to close in, panic spread. Georges Danton made impassioned calls for men to defend the republic and tens of 1000s of troops left Paris for the front lines. However, in their absence, Paris was left to its own devices. As enemy troops arrived in Verdun, the people of Paris feared that their crowded prisons were becoming a breeding ground for counterrevolutionary conspiracy. What would happen if the Prussians reached Paris and freed the aristocrats? Marat believed he knew what would happen. The aristocrats would enact their vengeance on the people. Fearing those they had already imprisoned, mobs descended on Paris's prisons. They broke in. And during the brutal September massacres, aristocrats, priests and others were tried and executed on the spot. Even women and children weren't spared. With over 1,600 victims, word of the massacre spread across Europe. One British newspaper wondered, are these the rights of men? Is this the liberty of human nature? But there was still one man in particular that Robespierre and his radicals really wanted to see executed. Austria and Prussia pledged that after they defeated France, they'd returned King Louis to the throne. Well checkmate Austria and Prussia because he can't return a man to the throne if he's already dead. Citizen Louis Capet was put on trial for treason. Obviously he was found guilty, but his punishment was less certain. Many moderates wanted to simply deport him. But Robespierre insisted the revolution could only live if the king was dead. A vote was held and by just one vote, Louis was sentenced to the guillotine. If you don't mind, I'd like to say a few words first. Gentlemen, I am innocent of everything of which I am accused... Wait, you're too loud. They can't hear me. Hang on, I haven't finished yet. Wait, dude. Uncool. In her prison cell, Marie Antoinette heard the guns fire signaling her husband's death. Before long, she would meet the same fate. Back on the war front, France defied all expectations, and actually managed to push the enemy back. But then more countries joined the coalition against France and it all went to pot again. What do we do? Conscript the masses. The National Convention introduced a conscription law with each regional department having to meet a certain quota of men for the army. However, not everyone was happy with this new law. You see, while Paris was definitely a hotbed for radical revolutionary fervor, some of the regions outside of Paris weren't quite so keen on the revolution. Some were largely still conservative, still supported the church and just didn't suffer from that much inequality before the revolution. So as the revolution turned increasingly violent and anti-Christian, many were outraged. Now they were being conscripted to fight for the new republic they hated. That was the last straw. Counterrevolutionary uprisings erupted in a number of regions across France. Some would last for years, such as in the Northwest where a large scale uprising was led by The Owls. Why were they called The Owls? Because their leader was named Jean Owl. Why was he called John Owl? Possibly because he could do a really good impression of an owl. Really? That's what we're going with? Owls? Just because this guy can do an impression of one? Hit him with it, Jean. Hoot, hoot. Yeah, okay. That's pretty good. The Chouanary uprising lasted all the way until 1800. In the summer of 1793, the southern city of Toulon invited the British Navy over for some tea and crumpets. And then they asked if they'd possibly like to stay and occupy the city. Being an important naval base, this was a heavy blow to the republic who sent a relatively unknown young captain by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte to help stage the siege of the city. Toulon was recaptured by France in the winter and for his service Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. The most infamous counterrevolution, however, occurred in the Vendee region. Throughout 1793, revolutionary forces clashed with the region's Catholic and royal army. The republic defeated the counterrevolution through cruel pacification. In particular, general Jean Baptist Carrier committed brutal atrocities. In one instance, he had 1000s of civilians, priests, women and children tied to ships, which were then sunk. Carrier would later be found guilty of war crimes and executed. Back in Paris, the government was still dominated by moderates. With the war going badly, revolts in the provinces and the economy getting worse, it seemed the government just wasn't doing a very good job. Radicals' fear for the safety of the revolution intensified and Marat even began calling for the moderates in the government to be executed. In return, the moderates called for the arrest of Marat. This led to a chain of events with the two sides in heated conflict. Robespierre declared the Jacobins to be be an insurrection and called on the people to arm themselves. It all ended on the 31st of May, 1793 with the National Convention surrounded by radical Sans-culottes and 29 moderate Girondin politicians arrested. From this moment on, the moderate ceased to be a political force. Robespierre and his radicals would be an almost total control of the government. And this brings us to the story of a woman named Charlotte Corday. Charlotte lived in the northwest city of Caen and like many in the area was horrified at the rapid radicalization and increasing violence of the revolution. And the man she blamed more than anyone was Jean Paul Marat. She wanted to bring peace back to France. And so she did something drastic. She traveled to Paris and told Marat she had a list of enemies for him to publish in his paper. Marat eagerly invited her in for a meeting. So where's that list of enemies you promised me? Here it is. Wait a minute. This isn't the list of enemies. It just says 'yippee ki yay mother...' (Marat screams) And just like that, Marat was no more. Charlotte was quickly arrested and sent to the guillotine. Her dream of restoring peace, however, died with her. Marat became a martyr. In temples of reason, symbols of the dead Marat became the new crucifix. In death, he became an even more powerful inspiration for the extreme levels of violence that were about to rip throughout the new republic. And that's right. Here comes the reign of terror. If you thought this revolution already sounds pretty violent, well you ain't seen nothing yet, son. The radicals were now in control and they believed not only was France surrounded by foreign enemies,","King Louis XVI and his family, confined in the Tuileries Palace, struggled with increasing demands from the revolutionaries, leading him to attempt an escape to the Austrian Netherlands, only to be caught and seen as a traitor. His powers were reduced, and radicals, like the Jacobins, called for his complete removal. After a massacre of revolutionaries and growing unrest, the monarchy was suspended, and Louis was imprisoned. The National Convention declared the French Republic, which led to violent purges against clergy, nobility, and counterrevolutionaries. Amid the chaos, Louis was tried for treason, found guilty, and executed, followed by his wife Marie Antoinette. Revolutionary violence spread across France, with uprisings and massacres, including the September Massacres, and the rise of Napoleon. The radicals, now in control, led the Reign of Terror, escalating the revolution's bloodshed, marked by widespread executions and brutality."

(At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly","The video humorously outlines the lead-up to the French Revolution, beginning with King Louis XVI’s reign amid France’s financial ruin. Despite growing discontent and the nobility's lavish lifestyles, the monarchy's response was to tax the poor while the rich remained largely untouched. As the population suffered from poverty, food shortages, and skyrocketing bread prices, unrest grew. The Estates General was summoned but its unfair voting system led the Third Estate, representing 98% of the population, to form the National Assembly. Tensions escalated, with the people fearing the king's actions and ultimately leading to the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, signaling the start of the revolution."
"I've decided that in order to sell more merch, I should do a face reveal wearing it. So are you ready? Here we go! Boom. New minimalist and Cold War merch available now. And get the new limited edition Churchill character pin before it sells out, with more characters coming in the future. Link in the description down below. The year is 1917. Fighting rages on the eastern front of the First World War. Both Germany and Russia are on the brink of collapse. - 'Soldier, I need you to bring me this man.' - 'Got it.' - 'Found him, sir.' - 'Wha-... who ... NO...' 'Not LennON!' 'LenIN! The Russian communist! What!?' 'Why would I need a Beatle?! Lenin! The Russian communist! He was exiled to Switzerland!' - 'You know what? I'll do it myself.' - 'Who wants to start a revolution?!!' *USSR ANTHEM STARTS TO PLAY* - The Germans put Lenin on a train and sent him all the way back to Russia, hoping he and his mates would create an internal crisis. And create an internal crisis they did. The government was overthrown and Lenin was in charge. He immediately pulled out of the First World War, made the country Communist, started a three-year long civil war, got shot, broke the economy, caused a famine, and then he died. On his deathbed, he said, - 'Hey, man, tell whoever's in charge of giving people jobs not to let that jerk Stalin become the next leader.' 'By the way, who did I put in charge of giving people jobs?' - 'That would be Stalin, sir.' *dies* - Stalin was a rising force in the Communist Party. He still had some opponents but conveniently, all of them were arrested or disappeared. So that was lucky. And so Stalin took over. He implemented his Five-Year Plans which transformed the country from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial one. And like Lenin before him, he reigned with terror. Anyone who dared criticize or oppose him would either be killed or left to rot in the horrendous Soviet work camps. Then, a short man with a silly mustache tried to take over the world, punched the Russians all the way to Moscow, and then the Russians, with some help from their faithful ally, the Winter, punched them all the way back to Berlin. At this point, being allies, America, the UK and the Soviet Union were good chums. They held a couple of conferences near the end of the war to decide what would happen next. - 'Hey Stalin, after all your trials and tribulation,' 'you must be pretty happy to be standing here in Berlin.' - 'Tsar Alexander made it all the way to Paris.' - 'Uhhh...' 'Hey, uh,' 'j-just' 'give me a second' (whispering) 'Hey man, I think something's up with Stalin.' - 'I know, right?' 'What should we do?' - 'Shall I tell him about the bomb?' - 'Yeah, tell him about the bomb.' 'That will scare him.' - 'Sooo...' 'we got this crazy new big A-bomb' 'that can destroy an entire city in one go.' - 'Yes, my spies told me already.' 'Oh wait, I meant to act surprised.' 'WOW! THAT'S AMAZING!' - 'He already knew!' 'How?!' - 'Ummm...' - 'Am I sure I want to send nuclear secrets via' 'unsecure, public, coffee-shop Wi-Fi?' 'AM I EVER!' 'AM I EVER!' *SENT* - 'Dude, use a VPN.' - And speaking of VPNs...

Oh, yeah. - 'Does the 'A' stand for atomic or ass?' - Then America dropped their big 'A' bomb on Japan and World War II officially came to an end. - 'Hooray! We won!' 'Okay, so now it's time to establish the New World Order.' 'Stalin, you're in charge of Eastern Europe.' 'Now, we want you to let them all hold elections.' - 'Oh, yes, of course.' 'Elections.' - 'And these elections will be free and fair, right?' - 'Oh yes. Certainly.' 'Free and fair.' 'Definitely free and fair.' 'Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist.' 'If that's not free and fair, I don't know what is.' - Throughout Eastern Europe, Soviet puppet governments were established as a buffer zone between the USSR and the West, with Churchill proclaiming an Iron Curtain had descended across the continent. The relationship between the old Allies was deteriorating fast. Over the next few years, the British intervened in the Greek Civil War to prevent a communist takeover. In Turkey, the Russians began demanding more control of Turkey's sea access routes, which prompted the US to send their largest battleship to Turkey for a friendly visit. After World War II, Iran was now occupied by both the Soviets and the British, with an agreement to both pull out once the war was over. The British pulled out; Stalin was like, - 'You know what, I think I might stick around.' - 'All in favor of kicking Russia out of Iran?' - 'You want to know something?' - 'You guys suck.' - Pressure from the UN forced the Soviets to leave, and with the establishment of NATO, the Soviets had no doubt that the West was out to encircle and destroy them. And America announced the Truman Doctrine, in which they basically said, - 'Those guys are not cool,' 'cannot be trusted,' 'and we will do everything we can' 'to prevent the spread of Communism around the world.' - Many view this moment as the official declaration of the Cold War. Back in Europe... Everyone was living in a post-apocalyptic void brought on by the Second World War. Cities reduced to rubble, not enough food... It was terrible. - 'This is great!' 'The more they suffer,' 'the more likely it is they'll turn to communism!' - 'Dude, you're really messed up.' 'What's wrong with you?' - 'My father used to punish me severely.' - America realized what was going on, and quickly made a move. Under the Marshall Plan, they sent 12 billion dollars to Western Europe for its economic recovery. The countries of Stalin's Eastern Bloc looked on with envy. - 'Hey Czechoslovakia.' 'You want to come get some economic aid?' - 'Yeah, but I have to check with my mom first.' - 'Sorry America...' 'I can't come.' This was a full-on economic battle raging between capitalism and communism in Europe. If the Western nations developed faster and better than the East, that would be a defeat for Stalin. So he set up his own rival economic recovery plan, which he called 'COMECON'. And he also set up 'COMINFORM', which gave him more political control over the Eastern Block. But nowhere did this economic battle rage harder than in the city of Berlin. Caught over a 100 miles (160 km) behind Soviet lines, the city had been divided up between the Allies. And the western segments were still under Western control. East Berliners could travel freely to West Berlin, see the economic prosperity and think, - 'Hmmm...' 'Maybe this communism thing ain't so great after all.' 'I'm gonna have fun tonight!' *opens door* *turn on lights* - 'You're home late.' - 'Oh,' 'Stalin...' 'I was just out with my friends.' - 'Friends?!' 'You stink of capitalism!' 'You wrere out engaging in imperialist debauchery again!' 'I swear, Ivan, I can't keep doing this.' - Stalin wanted the West out. So he said, - 'Hey, guess what?' 'I'm blockading all of your supply routes to West Berlin.' 'What are you gonna do about it?' - 'I suppose we'll just fly the supplies in.' - 'Alright Truman,' 'You win this round.' The Berlin Airlift was an incredible undertaking and a major success for the Western Allies. And Stalin ended his blockade of West Berlin. His aggressive actions worried the West, but not as much as this did. *A-Bomb kaboom* The Soviet Union had developed their very own atomic bomb. The USA no longer had a nuclear monopoly. The world now knew that if a major war broke out between the two superpowers, It would be more destructive than anyone could imagine. So it was comforting when Stalin came out and said that war between the Soviet Union and the West was unlikely. Oh wait, inevitable! He said it was inevitable. - 'Hey, you know who I haven't checked in on in a while?' 'My good friend, China!' - 'Whoa, what happened to you?' What happened to them was a full-blown civil war that had been going on since 1927. The People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, successfully defeated the Republic of China, who fled to Taiwan. The now communist China and the Soviet Union signed a mutual defense treaty. This was terrible news for the West. But wait! There's more! After the Second World War, Korea was divided along the 38th parallel. In the north, the Soviets set up a communist regime. In the south, America set up an anti-communist regime. Both were led by very sweet-looking old men. But don't let that deceive you. They were both ruthless dictators, and both dreamed of reuniting Korea under their own regime. Now that he had the bomb, Stalin was feeling a little more cocky and he finally gave Kim permission to attack. The North launched a surprise invasion of the South on June 25th, 1950. With Soviet aid, the North Koreans steamrolled through, taking Seoul in just three days, and replacing one ruthless dictator with another. The UN were freaking out, and quickly created an emergency force made up of troops from 16 countries to defend the south. The West still held Busan, and made landings at Incheon near Seoul. They pushed the North Koreans out of Seoul, replacing the ruthless dictator that had replaced the first ruthless dictator with the same ruthless dictator that had previously been replaced by the new ruthless dictator. And the West then continued all the way up the Korean Peninsula. At this point China was getting worried that the UN may just keep going. The US had sent this guy to lead the operation. After winning the Pacific theater of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur's head was big, and his balls were bigger. He reassured President Truman that there was absolutely no way at all that the Chinese would ever get involved. Meanwhile, half a million Chinese troops were crossing into Korea. - 'Nuke 'em.' - 'No.' - 'NUKE 'EM!' - 'NO!' - 'Aw, c'moooon.' - 'You're fired!' - The US considered the nuclear option, but now that the Soviets also had the bomb, they didn't want to risk all-out global destruction. The Communists pushed the West right back almost to the exact same spot they had all started from, and they ended up in a stalemate, where they remained until both sides finally agreed to work towards a peace settlement in 2018. Back in America, Americans decided they wanted a new president who would be tough on communism. So they elected famed World War II general, Eisenhower, who is really hard to draw. It's 1953. Hey Stalin, how you doing-- Oh, he's dead. He had a cerebral hemorrhage, and his reign of terror kinda came back to bite him in the ass. Because he had imprisoned all of his best doctors, and those that were left were too terrified to treat him. The new leader, Nikita Khrushchev, called a meeting, and said, - 'Hey guys.' 'You know how Stalin was imprisoning' 'and murdering us all for doing basically nothing?' 'Yeah, he was kind of a jerk.' *gasp omg* - 'I'm really not sure how this is news to you.' Khrushchev went on a campaign of de-Stalinization. Statues of Stalin were taken down, Stalingrad was renamed, and Khrushchev announced that he wanted the Soviet people to be happy and would allow greater freedom in the Soviet Union. So how did that work out? Well, an uprising in East Germany was brutally suppressed. A revolution in Hungary was brutally suppressed. And demonstrations in Poland were brutally suppressed. Although he did finally allow some mild reforms. Back in the Soviet Union, he permitted more cultural expression, but then began banning stuff based on his own personal taste. - 'Modern art looks like a child' 'urinated on a canvas.' 'Banned!' - 'Jazz music sounds like' 'the feeling of needing to fart.' 'Banned!' - 'Your poetry is really depressing!' 'How could anyone in the Soviet Union be depressed?' 'You're banned!' Khrushchev wanted the Soviet people to be happy, but not like that, or that, or that. Young people began enjoying abhorrent Western pop culture. - 'Son, remove that disgusting imperialist apparel at once!' - 'Shut up, Dad!' 'You can't tell me what to do!' 'Well would you look at that.' 'Turns out he CAN tell me what to do.' The West had initially liked the cut of Khrushchev's jib, but world events soon soured relations even more. The two sides were spying on each other a whole lot throughout the Cold War. The KGB had spies and informants in nearly every aspect of Western life and government; so much so that whenever the US tried to send spies into the Soviet Union, the KGB were usually ready to arrest them on the spot. Members of the Manhattan Project aided the Soviet Union in acquiring the bomb. Some American officials believed they were on the wrong side. - 'I'll sell you three secrets for five million dollars.' - 'Okay, go ahead.' - 'The Allies are digging a tunnel under East Berlin to tap your communications,' there's an American agent living at this address in Moscow,' 'and sometimes when I'm home alone,' 'I like to put on my wife's dresses, sit in the corner,' 'and cry for hours' *weird* - 'Very interesting.' In America fear took hold during the Red Scare and the McCarthy trials. American values imploded as fear of communism collided with freedom of thought and expression, and 'Communist' kind of became a buzzword thrown around to describe anything people didn't like; Hollywood? Communist! Your next-door neighbor's dog? Communist!! When the grocery store cashier asks If you need a bag when","The transcript covers key moments from the early Cold War era, starting with the Russian Revolution and Lenin's rise to power, followed by Stalin's leadership and the transformation of the Soviet Union. It details the development of the atomic bomb by both the US and the Soviet Union, the division of Europe, the establishment of NATO, and the economic rivalry between capitalism and communism. Tensions escalate with the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, and the spread of communism into China and Eastern Europe. Stalin's death leads to Khrushchev's rise, his attempts at reform, and increased espionage between the superpowers, alongside the growing fear of communism in the US."

Also, new French Revolution Merch available now in the store, including King Louis and Marie Antoinette character pins, complete with detachable heads just like the real thing. (At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side.

Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly","The video describes the events leading to the French Revolution, focusing on King Louis XVI's weak leadership, France's financial struggles, and widespread discontent among the poor. Despite the monarchy's extravagant spending and ineffective leadership, the French elite continued their lavish lifestyle while the common people endured hardships, including heavy taxation and food scarcity. As economic conditions worsened, philosophical ideas from the Enlightenment spurred demands for equality, leading to the formation of the National Assembly by the Third Estate. Amid fears of repression and growing unrest, the people of Paris revolted, culminating in the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789."

(At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side.

Clearly","The video narrates the events leading to the French Revolution, highlighting the excesses of the French monarchy and the growing discontent among the populace. King Louis XVI, weak and easily manipulated, inherits a bankrupt nation and worsens the financial crisis by supporting the American Revolution. Meanwhile, the lavish lifestyle of Queen Marie Antoinette, coupled with harsh taxes on the poor, fuels widespread anger. As economic hardships intensify, including famine and high bread prices, the Third Estate, representing the common people, begins to push for reform, eventually forming the National Assembly.

"This is the biggest, most ambitious, most expensive video I've ever made. And it's also gonna be terrifying. We are strapping these giant metal weights to the belly of that helicopter, flying it up several kilometers in the sky and then dropping these weights, on a sandcastle city. I mean, we need luck. (dramatic music) Here we go. - Oh my. YEAH! And this is all for a very good reason. So let's do it. Come on. In the late 1950s, the United States had a problem. The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, into orbit around the earth on the 4th of October, 1957, but less well known is that just over a month earlier, they successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM. It could deliver a nuclear warhead from the Soviet Union to cities on the US East Coast, in around 30 minutes. Facing this threat, a researcher at Boeing named Jerry Pournelle came up with an idea for a space weapon. It could hit any location on Earth in half that time, just 15 minutes. It could destroy targets buried 30 meters underground like the silos where the Soviet nukes were kept. And theoretically it could intercept ICBM's mid-flight. His concept was to put telephone pole sized pieces of tungsten in space, in orbit. So that these pieces of tungsten could drop on a target basically at any time. The idea was within a 15 minute window you would be able to release one of these tungsten rods and have it re-enter the atmosphere and strike a target in minutes. And it would come in so fast, you know, in orbit things go about eight kilometers per second, and as it enters the atmosphere, it's gonna slow down due to the atmospheric drag, but still on impact it's still gonna be going like 10 times the speed of sound. Mach 10 or about three kilometers per second. This is MOAB, which stands for massive ordinance air blast but it's more commonly referred to by its nickname the Mother of All Bombs. It is one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives on the planet. When it detonated, it released the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT. Now, just one of these tungsten rods coming in would have the same energy as the largest conventional explosive ever detonated. They are not bombs, they contain no explosives but the amount of energy that they're carrying in their kinetic energy because they are so heavy and they're going so fast it is as big as any conventional bomb ever detonated. Pournelle called his weapon Project Thor after the Norse God who threw lightning bolts from the heavens. In the 1980s the kinetic missile interceptor idea was seriously considered by the Reagan administration. It was codenamed, Brilliant Pebbles but the project was abandoned. In 2003 it was resurrected by the Air Force Transformation Plan which referred to this weapon as hypervelocity rod bundles. But colloquially, the weapon is known as Rods from God. The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass and its velocity squared. So increasing the objects mass 10 times, increases its kinetic energy 10 times. But if you increase the velocity by a factor of 10 the kinetic energy grows by a factor of a hundred. This is why even very light objects can carry lots of kinetic energy. This is what a 15 gram piece of plastic does to a block of aluminum when traveling at six kilometers per second. And this is a real problem for satellites because of the massive speeds on orbit, micro meteorites, small bolts, or even flecks of paint are serious risks for the astronauts living onboard the International Space Station. This chip in the window of the ISS was caused by a tiny speck of dust. And a small piece of space junk punctured a hole in the robotic arm. Imagine something that weighs 10 tons traveling that fast. Kinetic energy weapons appear in fiction including dozens of movies, video games and books. But how realistic are they? I mean, could this weapon ever become a reality? Well, that's why we're here in the middle of the desert. We wanna see how damaging a Rod from God could be. And we really pulled out all the stops, even hiring a team of professional sandcastle builders to construct a city onto which we'll drop the rods. I have all the respect in the world, for these sandcastle builders. - We are seven time US Open Sand Castle Champions. - That's so cool. It'll endure the test of the highest weight at the highest drop with very little damage. I'm really convinced of that. - The US Capital was great. - Yeah, isn't that great? - Yeah. - It's one of our favorite. - I love all the buildings there. Who did the pickle? The Gherkin? - Yeah, the Gherkin right here. - Very nice. This is beautiful. I mean, I feel bad for trying to hit it. I am just very concerned about aiming, the city is not that big. So before we get to that drop we're gonna try to hit this swimming pool with a 100 kilogram or a 220 pound mass. Probably go up about 500 meters. Try to drop a weight right into this pool. I don't think it's gonna work. I don't think we're gonna hit it. In fact, my main concern for the whole day is that we're just not gonna be able to hit anything. And then what was the point in coming out here in the first place? These are gonna be the questions that I ask myself. So the way we're targeting is with GPS, we're gonna take a GPS mark from like the center of the pool. Oh boy. We've also got GPS in the helicopter. We're gonna use that to try to line up square over the middle of the pool. So if we're able to hit this pool from 500 meters then I think we've got a shot. (dramatic music) - Where's your GPS? - My GPS is my phone. And I have the coordinates written on my arm. We're ready to go. We're professionals - First drop and it's feeling shaky I gotta tell you. I'm surprised it can pull a load that heavy! - We've got another 700 feet to be at 1500. - Okay. - I just dunno like why they're circling up that high. Is that 500 meters? That seems really high. - Ryan to Rick, what's your altitude? - 500 meters. - We're 1500 feet, that seems higher than 1500 feet. - They're at 500 meters right now. - That is freaking crazy, okay. - Here we go. This is the one. - This is the one. - It's swinging around like crazy up there! - Yeah. Does it have fins on it? - Jesus. No. No fins. Why didn't we have this conversation a week ago? - Looking good? - We're good left to right. That's good. We just need to go forward. - Oh geez. That does not look like they're in position, right? Are you kidding me? - It never will. - Its dropped. - Oh my. What the? What is that gonna hit? Oh, it is going sideways. What did it hit? - Way past the sandcastle. - Oh geez. That was way more off than I thought. - Oh my God. - I was right on. Was yours showing the same thing back there? - Yeah, we were right on it. - Yeah. Good. Well that's kinda weird. That's just gonna show you what's gonna happen at altitude. We both said we were right on it and we weren't. - It didn't look like you guys were moving, but... - Yeah he's telling me our horizontal velocity was zero. - And you were in the right spot? - We were exactly in the right spot. - Oh wow. Oh wow! Look at that. - Oh Wow. - Totally, totally buried. Falling from 500 meters, the rod accelerated for 10 seconds. And even accounting for air resistance it hit the ground going about 350 kilometers per hour. At that speed, with a mass of a hundred kilograms it was carrying nearly half a million joules of kinetic energy. Our plan for the day is to drop something twice as heavy from six times higher. Then it's energy on impact will be greater than the explosion of a kilogram of TNT. Kinetic impacts are explosive. If you look at the craters on the moon and you look really closely you're gonna see that they're basically all circles. I think no one stops to ask why are they circular? If you imagine when the moon gets hit by asteroids they're gonna come in from all different directions. So shouldn't you get these sort of oblong shapes where the asteroid comes in? Well, the truth is, the asteroids come in with such incredible speed that it's not like they're pushing dirt out of the way and that's what creates the crater. No, they're coming in so fast that when they collide their kinetic energy is explosive. It heats up the ground, turns things into liquid and gas. They all get super hot and they spray outwards in a giant explosion. And this explosion is symmetric. It doesn't matter which angle or how shallow the asteroid was coming in, it's gonna blow out everything radially because it is explosive. Kinetic energy is explosive. And I think for me, that's just the really surprising thing. It would be the exact same thing with dropping these rods going Mach 10, when they hit a target they're gonna create an explosion as though they are the largest conventional weapon ever launched. And because it's going so fast, it can penetrate around 30 meters of soil, enough to bust bunkers or silos. And the explosion is therefore more localized. So it can be used for precise surgical strikes. Plus, unlike a nuclear weapon there's no radioactive fallout to worry about or international laws. Do these ideas contravene any current laws or treaties? - No. The only international agreement there is about putting weapons in space is about nuclear weapons. The only real prohibition is about putting nuclear weapons in space. - Man, like I thought targets would be hard to hit. Now I'm like super convinced they're impossible to hit. - What we're gonna do now, we're gonna do a much lower altitude and we're gonna do it visually. - Yeah. Great. - So we're gonna do it, you know, 300 feet visually. - I love it. We're gonna do a cube drop. Cube drop, is interesting cause I was like we shouldn't do a cube drop. We're here talking about Rods from God. They're cylinders right? Now I'm so thankful we have the cubes because the cylinders, as Adam Savage told me, - Cylinders tend to fall on their sides, given enough chance. - Really? Who would've thought I would've thought like, you know, a pencil type thing, it would tend to aim straight down. That still looks high. Is that a hundred meters? Does that? 30 second call, it doesn't look like they're over the pool. It's totally blowing around in the wind. It's totally swinging. - GPS is spot on and I see it right below. - Still feels high. - We're on it. We're on it. - Here we go. - All right. That wasn't far off. - We're off by 60 feet. - Yeah. Oh wow. Did it look like we were right above it? - Looked like it yeah. - Wow. 'Cause I still was right on it as well. - That's something, from a hundred meters. I'll take it. Okay, we're setting up to drop this mass. 200 kilograms, 440 pounds. What do you think? - Yeah, we're gonna get there. - Are we gonna hit it this time? - I hope so. This is the moment of truth. We've had two misses so far. So we're going 50 meters or 150 feet above the pool which for me it's pretty disappointing. But at this point I just want to hit something. - 30 seconds! 30 seconds! - Oh boy. The weight is swinging around on there. It's getting blown around by the wind. I mean we need luck. There it goes, there it goes, there it goes. I'm tracking, tracking. Got a hit of the pool! - (screaming) Yes! (crew all cheer) - It hit something. - Yes! - It was like right on the edge. Right on the edge. - WOO! - This morning I was so worried that we weren't going to hit anything. And like I think the footage is so shaky cause I was so excited. But like seeing that from above was amazing. - Wow. It ripped right through the pool. - That's crazy. - Unbelievable. - Oh, look at the rubber duckies. - So, is the next target, the sandcastle? And you wanna go for a hundred meters? - I wanna double it. - This will be amazing if we can actually hit the sandcastle from a hundred meters. That'll be something In all the different incarnations of Rods from God. The rods are made out of tungsten. And there are two reasons for this. The first is that tungsten is really, really dense. A cubic meter of tungsten weighs 19 tons. That's over twice the density of steel which is what we're using here just because it's a lot cheaper. But that means for a given amount of mass tungsten rods could be less than half the volume of steel and therefore encounter less resistance as they pass through the atmosphere. And importantly for re-entry, tungsten also has an incredibly high melting point. The highest of any metal, at almost three and a half thousand degrees celsius. This is important because as the rod decelerates through the atmosphere a lot of heat builds up all around it. And tungsten's high melting point means the rods require much less shielding to prevent them from melting. The shape is also important. The goal is to hit the target with as much speed as possible. So a sleek, aerodynamic shape is best and rods are a great shape for that. Aerodynamics is why arrows and bullets and ballistic missiles all look the way they do. It's to minimize drag. Honestly one of the big mistakes we made was not welding fins onto our rods. We're going up to about a hundred meters or 300 feet, before we drop. We're gonna hit the sandcastle city. That's the goal. - Any minute, any second. - There it goes, there it goes, there it goes. It's going. Did it hit in front? - Just in font. - Hit just in front. - We just missed it. - We were close. We were really","The video describes an experiment involving the drop of large metal weights from a helicopter to simulate a kinetic weapon known as 'Rods from God.' Inspired by a concept from the Cold War, this weapon uses tungsten rods to strike targets with extreme speed, causing massive kinetic energy impact without explosives. The goal is to test the destructive power of these rods by dropping them on a sandcastle city. After several attempts with various weights and altitudes, the team manages to hit a swimming pool with a 220-pound mass and nearly strikes the sandcastle, illustrating the challenges and potential of this weapon."
"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com. So, I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost. The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always count on YouTube monetization. So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after","Fritz Haber, awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the Haber process to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen, revolutionized agriculture and supported global population growth by making nitrogen fertilizer widely available. However, his legacy is marred by his role in World War I, where he advanced chemical weapons, including chlorine gas, resulting in thousands of deaths. Despite his contributions to both life-saving and deadly technologies, his reputation was tarnished, and his scientific career ended in disgrace after the war and the rise of the Nazis. Haber's work on nitrogen chemistry had profound, lasting impacts, but his involvement in wartime chemical warfare remains controversial."
"- This is a video about things like cars, phones, and light bulbs and an actual conspiracy that made them worse. This video was sponsored by NordVPN, more about them at the end of the video I am outside Livermore Fire Station, number six. And in here, they have the longest, continuously on light bulb in the world. It has been on for 120 years since 1901. There it is. - [Host] Yeah, that's it. - It's not even connected to a light switch but it does have a backup battery and generator. So the big question is, how has this light bulb lasted so long? It was manufactured by hand not long after commercial light bulbs were first invented, And yet, it has been running for over a million hours, way longer than any light bulb today is meant to last. Awhile back, a friend of mine told me this story, that someone had invented a light bulb that would last forever years ago, but they never sold it because an everlasting light bulb makes for a terrible business model. I mean, you would never have any repeat customers and eventually you would run out of people to sell light bulbs to, I thought this story sounded ridiculous. If you could make an everlasting light bulb, then everyone would buy your light bulb over the competitors. And so you could charge really high prices, make a lot of money, even if demand would eventually dry up. I just couldn't imagine that we had better light bulbs in the past and then intentionally made them worse, but it turns out I was wrong. At least sort of. Inventing a viable electric light was hard, I mean, this is the typical incandescent design, which just involves passing electric current through a material making it so hot that it glows, less than 5% of the electrical energy comes out as light. The other 95% is released as heat. So these are really heat bulbs, which give off a little bit of light as a by-product. The temperature of the filament can get up to 2,800 Kelvin. That is half as hot as the surface of the sun. At temperatures like those, most materials melt. - That's so cool. - And if they don't melt, they burn, which is why in the 1840s, Warren De la Rue came up with the idea of putting the filament in a vacuum bulb, so there's no oxygen to react with. By 1879, Thomas Edison had made a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours. Other inventors created bulbs with platinum filaments or other carbonized materials. And gradually, the lifespan of bulbs increased. The filaments changed from carbon to tungsten, which has a very high melting point. And by the early 1920s, average bulb lifetimes were approaching 2,000 hours with some lasting 2,500 hours. But this is when lifetimes stopped getting longer and started getting shorter. In Geneva, Switzerland just before Christmas, 1924, there was a secret meeting of top executives from the world's leading light bulb companies, Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM from Germany, and the UK's Associated Electric among others. They formed what became known as the Phoebus Cartel named after Phoebus, the Greek God of light. There, all these companies agreed to work together to help each other by controlling the world supply of light bulbs. In the early days of the electrical industry, there had been lots of different small light bulb manufacturers, but by now they had largely been consolidated into these big corporations, each dominant in a particular part of the world. The biggest threat they all faced was from longer lasting light bulbs. For example, in 1923, OSRAM sold 63 million light bulbs, but the following year they sold only 28 million. Light bulbs were lasting too long, eating into sales. So all the companies in the cartel agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours cutting the existing average almost in half. But how could each company ensure that the other companies would actually follow the rules and make shorter lasting light bulb. After all, it would be in each of their individual interests to make a better product to outsell the others? Well, to enforce the 1,000 hour limit, each of the manufacturers have to send in sample bulbs from their factories and they were tested on big test stands like this one. If a bulb lasted significantly longer than 1,000 thousand hours, then the company was fined. If a bulb lasted longer than 3000 hours, well the fine was 200 Swiss Francs for every 1,000 bulbs sold. And there are records of these fines being issued to companies. But how do you make a worst light bulb in the first place? Well, the same engineers who had previously been tasked with extending the lifespan now had to find ways to decrease it. So they tried different materials, different shaped filaments, and thinner connections. And if you look at the data, they were successful. Ever since the formation of the cartel. the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased. So that by 1934, the average lifespan was just 1,205 hours. And just as they had planned, sales increased for cartel members by 25% in the four years after 1926. And even though the cost of components came down, the cartel kept prices virtually unchanged, so they increased their profit margins. So did people know that the light bulb companies were conspiring together to make their products worse? No, the Phoebus Cartel claimed that its purpose was to increase standardization and efficiency of light bulbs. I mean, they did establish this screw thread is standard. You can find it on virtually all light bulbs around the world now. But all evidence points to the cartels being motivated by profits and increased sales, not by what was best for consumers. So one of the reasons this light bulb has lasted so long is because it was made before the cartel era. Another reason is because the filament has always been run at low power, just four or five watts. It was meant to be a nightlight for the fire station to provide just enough light so that firemen wouldn't run into things at night. And the fact that it was always on reduced the thermal cycling of the filament and components limiting the stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction. The Phoebus Cartel was initially planned to last at least until 1955, but it fell apart in the 1930s. It was already struggling due to outside competition. And non-compliance amongst some of its members, but the outbreak of World War II is really what finished it off. So this cartel was dead, but its methods survived to this day. There are lots of companies out there that intentionally shortened the lifespan of their products it's a tactic known now as planned obsolescence. This was actually the subject of Casey Neistat's first viral video all the way back in 2003. - [Support] Thank you for calling Apple, my name is Ryan. May I have your first name please? - [Casey] Casey. - [Support] ] All right, and what seems to be the issue today? - [Casey] I have an iPod that I bought about 18 months ago and the battery is dead on it. - [Support] 18 months, okay, it's past it year, which basically means there'll be a charge of $255 plus a mailing fee to send it to us to refurbish, to correct it. But at that price, you might as well go get a new one. - [Narrator] This video got millions of views in a time before YouTube or social media. And it spawned a class action lawsuit, which Apple settled out of court, but it didn't stop the company from practicing planned obsolescence. After an iOS update in 2017, users of older iPhones found apps loading significantly slower or the device shutting down altogether. Apple said they throttled performance to protect the battery of older devices and increase their longevity. Of course, that wouldn't be an issue if the battery were replaceable. In a series of lawsuits that concluded in 2020, Apple was fined or reached settlements to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, undoubtedly, this amount pales in comparison to the extra revenue they generate by limiting the lifespan of their products. But some would argue that planned obsolescence isn't just about greed, but that it's also good for everyone. During the great depression in the 1930s when as much as 1/4 of Americans were out of work and real estate broker Bernard London proposed mandatory planned obsolescence as a way to get people back to work and lift America out of the depression. He wrote, 'I would have the government assign a lease of life to shoes, and homes, and machines when they are first created and they would be sold and used within the term of their existence, definitely known by the consumer. After the allotted time had expired, these things would be legally dead and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment.' Now, this might sound like a wild fringe idea, but people were clearly afraid of being put out of work by technological progress and products that were too good. There was even a popular Oscar nominated film about it. 'This is the man in the white suit from 1951.' It's about a scientist who invents the perfect fiber. It won't stain or break, or fray. - I think I've succeeded in the copolymerization of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules, both containing ionic groups. It's really perfectly simple. - [Narrator] The Academy award nomination was for best screenplay, I kid you not. Anyway, everyone is initially excited about our heroes scientific discovery. He makes a suit out of the thread and it has to be white because the fiber is so stain resistant, it can't even be dyed, but this is when trouble strikes, the factory owners realize they won't be able to sell as much of this thread because it's so durable. And the workers worry it'll put them out of a job. - Why can't you scientists leave things alone? What about my better washing when there's no washing to do? - This is when you get the climactic scene where factory workers and factory owners team up to chase down the scientist to destroy him and his invention. And believe it or not, this movie may have been inspired by real events. In the 1940s, the synthetic fiber nylon replaced silk in stockings, and it was so durable that the products became an overnight sensation. There were literal riots when women tried to get their hands on them. When the manufacturers realized they had made the product too good, they didn't destroy the fiber, but they did follow the example of the Phoebus Cartel. They instructed their engineers and scientists to find ways to weaken the product to shorten its lifespan, so people would have to buy more. Now, it seems like consumers are finally fighting back against planned obsolescence. In the European union and in over 25 states in the US, there's proposed legislation to enshrine the right to repair. And these laws would force manufacturers to make it easier to repair their products. They would have to provide information and access to parts. So you could replace a battery or fix a cracked screen at a third-party repair shop without voiding your warranty. So if right to repair does become law, does that mean artificial obsolescence will be gone for good? Sadly, no, because there is one last thing manufacturers can use to make their products obsolete, which is you. (instrumental music) Henry Ford released the first mass market car, the model T in 1908. And he envisioned it like a workhorse, an affordable tool that wouldn't wear out, a bit like the everlasting light bulb. In 1922 Ford said, 'We want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another, we never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete.' But by 1920, 55% of American families already owned a car. Nearly everyone that could afford one had one. And that same year, there was a small economic downturn driving down sales for both Ford and General Motors. In 1921, DuPont, the chemical and paint company took over the controlling share in General Motors. And they started experimenting with painting cars different colors, up until then, Henry Ford had said, you could have whatever color you like so long as it's black. It took a couple of years of testing, but in 1924, GM released their first cars in different colors. And soon after, they introduced a trick that feels very familiar now. Each new year, they would introduce cars in different colors. The goal wasn't just to make Ford's model T lookout dated, but to make their own cars feel outdated every year encouraging customers to trade in their old cars for shiny new ones. Years later, GM's head of design, Harley Earl, candidly discussed his role in creating what he called dynamic obsolescence. 'Our big job is to hasten obsolescence. In 1934, the average car ownership span was five years. Now, which was 1955, it is two years. When it is one year, we will have a perfect score. By the time he said this, General Motors was the most valuable company in the world and it's sold half of all vehicles purchased in the US every year. These days, the world's most valuable company, Apple, seems to have copied directly out of this playbook. I mean, new styles every year, check, new special colors every year, check, marginal technological improvement, check. I mean, is this useful innovation or just a gimmick? The inspiration for General Motors and hence for Apple comes from fashion where real innovation is all but impossible. So the only way to make people feel the urgency to get out there and buy is to create styles that last but one season. The trouble then is you run through these styles too quickly. And then what are you supposed to do? Well, just recycle the styles from a few decades ago. The iPhone also shows this recycling trend. I mean, just look at the way the edges were initially rounded and then they were squared off and then they were rounded again and now, they're squared off. And how much do you want to bet that the iPhone 14 has rounded edges? I think the point is that with design and styling, there is no best, there's only different, which is apparently enough to remind us that we don't have the latest and greatest, and so we have to rush out and keep buying. The only type of obsolescence we should support is technological, which brings","The video discusses the deliberate shortening of product lifespans through planned obsolescence, beginning with the Phoebus Cartel in 1924, where major light bulb companies conspired to reduce bulb lifespans to increase sales. This practice continued with other industries, including technology, as seen in Apple's iPhone battery throttling, and the automotive industry's strategy of introducing new car colors and designs annually to encourage trade-ins. While planned obsolescence can boost profits, it has led to consumer pushback and legislation such as the right to repair. However, manufacturers continue to innovate in ways that push for obsolescence through design, not technological improvements."
"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com. So, I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost. The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always count on YouTube monetization. So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after","Fritz Haber, awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, revolutionized agriculture with his invention of ammonia synthesis, which enabled mass fertilizer production, supporting the growth of the global population. His process, however, was later repurposed for explosives and chemical warfare during World War I, where he pioneered the use of chlorine gas in combat. Despite his profound contributions, Haber faced public backlash for his role in chemical warfare and was shunned by colleagues. His later years were marked by personal and professional losses, including the rise of the Nazi regime, which led to his resignation and eventual death in 1934."
"One single scientist created three inventions that accidentally caused the deaths of millions of people, including himself. Not only that, they decreased the average intelligence of people all around the world, increased crime rates, and caused two completely separate environmental disasters that we are still dealing with today. Part of this video is sponsored by Wren. More about them at the end of the show. In 1944, as a young chemist who had just finished his Master's, Clair Patterson went to work on the Manhattan Project, building the first nuclear weapons. His job was to concentrate uranium-235, the fissile fuel for bombs from the much more common uranium-238. And this required huge machines, mass spectrometers, which separated the two types of uranium by their slight difference in mass. After the war, Patterson went back to grad school to get his PhD, he picked a research project that would take advantage of his experience with mass spectrometers: measuring the age of the Earth. Radioactive rocks are effectively clocks. Uranium-238, for example, decays into thorium and then protactinium, and then 12 More decays until it ends up as lead-206, which is stable. The rate of this decay is consistent and can be measured. It takes four and a half billion years for half of a sample of U-238. to decay into lead-206 Patterson's PhD project was to determine the age of the Earth by measuring the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks, but to calibrate his instrument, first he used zircon crystals whose ages were known. Zircon is ideal for this purpose, because when it forms it contains trace amounts of uranium but absolutely no lead. So any lead that you later find inside a zircon, you know must be the product of a uranium decay. Patterson was tasked with measuring the lead content, and another student, George Tilton, measured uranium Tilton 's uranium measurements were fine. They matched predictions. But Patterson's lead measurements were all over the place. And they were many many times higher than they expected. We'd take George's uranium and my lead... Not right Patterson! There was lead there that didn't belong there. So where was all this extra lead coming from? That mystery would take over the rest of Clair Patterson's life and bring him to the literal ends of the earth. In 1908, a woman was driving across the Belle Isle bridge in Detroit. When her car stalled. A passing motorist stopped to help. In those days cars needed to be hand cranked to start. He knelt down and turned the crank, and the engine roared to life. A little too suddenly. The man couldn't get out of the way. The crank handle hit him in the face and broke his jaw. He died as a result of his injuries. His name was Byron Carter, and he was the founder of his own car company. So he was well connected in the Detroit Auto scene. He counted among his close friends, the founder of Cadillac, Henry Leland. Leland was so distraught over his friend's death that he resolved to eliminate hand cranks from his vehicles. Leland hired Charles Kettering to create a self- starting car. And by 1911, he had a working prototype. Hand cranking was difficult and dangerous, and best left to men, but a car that started itself changed everything. The world's first crankless car was the Cadillac Model 30. It was much more powerful than cars before it. It had a top speed of 45 miles per hour and 40 horsepower, double the Ford Model T. The Model 30 was a huge success for Cadillac, doubling the company's annual sales, but it had a problem. It was deafeningly loud. In internal combustion engines a piston compresses the fuel-air mixture, which is then ignited by a spark from the spark plug. The expanding hot gases push the piston back down. The problem with the Model 30 engine was it compressed the fuel-air mixture more than previous models so much in fact, that often the fuel would spontaneously combust before the spark from the spark plug. So rather than orderly, perfectly timed explosions, you'd get multiple haphazard combustions leading to turbulent pressure waves inside the cylinder. The resulting sound led the problem To become known as engine knocking. Knocking wasn't just hard on the ears, it hurt the engine's performance, it reduced power output and lowered fuel efficiency. The vibrations also damaged the piston and walls of the cylinder shortening the life of the engine. The good news was that engine knocking could be corrected by changing the fuel. Different fuels can withstand different levels of compression before detonating n-heptane for example, will spontaneously combust under only a little compression. Iso-octane, on the other hand can withstand a much higher compression ratio before it auto ignites. So it's much less likely to cause knocking. To quantify how much compression a fuel can withstand scientists came up with the octane rating system, they arbitrarily set iso-octane to have a rating of 100 and n-heptane a rating of zero. Now real fuels aren't made up of only these two ingredients. They're a mix of lots of different hydrocarbons. But the octane rating tells you what mixture of octane and heptane gives equivalent performance. For example, 98 octane fuel can withstand the same compression as a mixture of 98% octane and 2% heptane. Now, I'm going to take a little bit of 98 octane fuel and put it in this piston. And when I compress it, nothing happens which is exactly what you'd expect. This fuel can withstand a lot of compression. Diesel has an octane rating of 20. So it acts like a mixture of 20% iso-octane and 80% n-heptane. If I put a little bit of diesel in there, let's see what happens with the same compression ratio. There you go. You get a little explosion in there. That's because this is a low octane fuel. I mean, that's what diesel is meant to do. You compress it and it ignites. But you don't want this sort of fuel in an engine with spark plugs. The reason fancy cars demand high octane fuel is to prevent knocking in their high-compression high-performance engines. Kettering wanted to find an additive which would increase the octane rating of ordinary fuel and eliminate knocking in high-compression engines. So he hired a 27-year-old engineer Thomas Midgley Jr. Midgley experimented with all sorts of compounds from melted butter and camphor, to ethyl acetate and aluminum chloride. He later wrote, most of them had no more effect than spitting in the Great Lakes. Ethanol was an interesting exception, it did stop the knocking, but you needed a lot of it about 10% of the fuel mixture for it to be effective, that much ethanol would be expensive and hard to turn a profit on. And Midgley was really after an additive that was cheap, easy to produce and effective even at low concentrations. So he kept trying. Then he hit on tellurium. It worked wonderfully as an anti knock agent, but it had a terrible smell. You couldn't get rid of it by changing clothes or bathing. His wife was so offended by the stench that he had to sleep in the basement for seven months, Midgley wrote, I don't think that although this doubled the fuel economy, humanity would suffer this smell. On December 3 1921, after five years of working on the problem, Midgley found what he thought was the perfect solution, tetraethyl lead. That's a lead atom right there in the center. This additive was exactly what he was looking for. It stopped the knocking, it didn't smell. It was cheap to produce and readily available. Best of all, you only needed one part in 1000, for it to be effective. In a call to Kettering, Midgley said, can you imagine how much money we're going to make with this? We're going to make $200 million, maybe even more. That is over 3 billion in today's dollars. Now for his discovery, the American Chemical Society gave him the prestigious Nichols award, and they asked him to do a series of public talks, but Midgley declined. He and Kettering patented the process for making Tetra ethyl led, and they called their new additive Ethyl, perhaps so it might be confused with another common additive ethyl alcohol they made no mention of lead. Then they teamed up with three of America's largest corporations General Motors, DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation. Their marketing was brilliant. No man can look at the amazing record of accomplishment here in this research division, without confidence that these men are going ahead with an eye to the future, looking for new facts and principles, which will make things better and make life easier for all of us. at the 1923 Indianapolis 500, the top three finishers all used Ethyl and the demand for leaded gasoline took off. To keep up Ethyl Corporation had to build a new chemical plant in New Jersey. But the project began terribly. Within two months of operating, dozens of workers fell ill with lead poisoning. Five of them died. To address the public outcry, Midgley held a press conference. And there he poured Tetraethyl lead onto his hands, and he inhaled it for a full minute. He claimed he could do this daily without harm. But Midgley knew the dangers. The reason he had turned down the public talks was because he spent much of 1923 in Florida, where he himself was recovering from lead poisoning. He didn't go anywhere near his company's product if he could help it. Lead is dangerous even in small doses, it mimics calcium in our bodies, so there's no efficient way to get rid of it. And like calcium lead can be stored in bones for years, meaning it can continue to poison the body long after the initial exposure. The organ most sensitive to lead is the brain. Lead breaks down the myelin sheath around axons and prevents the release of neurotransmitters. That's why common symptoms of lead poisoning are headaches, memory loss and tingling in the hands and feet. And children are particularly susceptible, lead exposure can cause permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems, and the dangers of lead had been known for hundreds of years. Already in 1786, Benjamin Franklin remarked that lead had been used for far too long considering its known toxicity, 'you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on'. He would have been aghast to learn that nearly 150 years later, scientists planned to add lead to fuel. Doctors and public health officials from MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the US health service, wrote to Midgley and warned them against producing Tetraethyl lead. They called lead a creeping and malicious poison and a serious menace to public health. Their concerns were dismissed. This model shows how just the right amount of fluid containing Tetraethyl lead and dye is added to the gasoline. No one doubted that a lot of lead was bad for you. But how much harm could a little lead do? By the 1950s, millions of motorists globally were burning lead in their cars and releasing it into the air. Some of that lead ended up on Clair Patterson's zircon on samples, preventing him from determining their age. In 1952, he moved to Caltech, where he built a new lab from scratch, suspicious of environmental contamination, he tore the electrical cables out of the walls to remove the lead solder. He cleaned the floors and benches daily with ammonia and made sure that air was always being blown out of the lab. To go inside, you had to wear a plastic bunny suit. Patterson basically invented the cleanroom. Inside that room, he turned his attention to the oldest rocks in the solar system. meteorites. All the original rocks on Earth had long since been destroyed by tectonic activity. But meteorites come from asteroids which formed around the same time as Earth. They have just been drifting through space until they entered the Earth's atmosphere. So the best way to measure the age of the Earth was to measure the age of meteorites. Patterson measured five meteorites, each with three different radiometric dating techniques, and he found they were all 4.55 billion years old. That number is within 0.15% of the currently accepted value for the age of the earth. You know, before Patterson's experiment, people thought the earth was a billion years younger. So Patterson had done it. He measured the age of the Earth, but he wasn't done getting rid of lead contaminants. Public concern about lead exposure had continued to grow. But President of Standard Oil, Frank Howard pushed back saying, 'We do not feel justified in giving up what has come to the industry like a gift from heaven, on the possibility that a hazard may be involved in it.' Scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation claimed that lead was a natural part of our environment, and therefore not harmful to people. But Patterson wondered just how natural is the lead in our environment, and he had just the skills to find out. He began by measuring lead in the oceans. If it were natural, he expected the concentration of lead to be the same regardless of depth. But if lead pollution had increased recently, it would be more concentrated near the surface. He took samples in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans down to a depth of four kilometers. And sure enough, lead concentrations were nearly 10 times higher near the surface. Lead pollution was clearly recent, but when exactly had it occurred? To find out Patterson had to go to Greenland and Antarctica. Ice cores record the level of lead in the air going back 1000s of years, the levels of lead in the atmosphere have been elevated for the last 4500 years. All of it is due to human activity mainly smelting ores to make metal. You can see the rise and fall of the Greek and Roman Empires. The dip caused by the Black Death in the 1300s. And of course, the spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and Tetraethyl lead. So what did this do to people? Well, Patterson looked at the lead levels in the teeth and bones of recently deceased Americans. And for comparison, he measured the lead in bones and teeth of Peruvian and Egyptian mummies. Since they lived over 1600 years ago, they would have been exposed to much less lead in their lifetimes. He expected to find modern Americans had about 100 times as much lead in their bones. But results showed it was closer to a factor of 1,000. 20th century Americans had 1000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors. Studies of baby teeth revealed that even","Clair Patterson, a scientist involved in the Manhattan Project, accidentally created three inventions that led to millions of deaths, decreased global intelligence, increased crime rates, and two ongoing environmental disasters. While working on uranium separation, Patterson's research eventually led him to measure the Earth's age using zircon crystals, but contamination from lead hampered his results. Meanwhile, in the early 20th century, Thomas Midgley Jr. invented tetraethyl lead, a gasoline additive that stopped engine knocking but caused widespread lead pollution. This resulted in major public health issues, including cognitive damage, especially in children. Patterson's work ultimately uncovered the widespread environmental and health impacts of lead exposure, which had increased dramatically due to industrialization and leaded gasoline."
"On the 4th of January, 2012, a user on 4chan posted this image to the site's infamous /b/ or random board. The anonymous author, who went by the four-digit pseudonym 3301, challenged users to uncover a message hidden within the image. Unbeknownst to those who stumbled across it, someone had just set in motion one of the most elaborate scavenger hunts the internet has ever seen. Within minutes of the image being posted someone discovered that by opening the file using a text editor an appended string of readable text could be found. The string contained a cipher that, once deciphered, formed a link to yet another image. At first this appeared to be a dead end but using an application known as OutGuess users were able to extract hidden information embedded within the first image. The extracted information lead to a subreddit which in turn contained information about a book. The book along with a code could then be used to uncover a phone number that, when called, played this prerecorded message. By the following day, the initial image had been reposed all over the internet. A growing community of armchair detectives sought to unravel this elaborate puzzle but no one was quite sure what to make off it. What was the puzzle for? Who was behind it? What happens when you reach the end? Some naturally dismissed it as an elaborate joke while others perceived its complexity as evidence against it being the work of a mere troll. Before long, rumors began to circulate that this could be the work of some secret society or intelligence agency with the intent of recruiting individuals proficient in cryptography, steganography, and other related fields. Of course, it was nothing but a rumor. The two missing numbers mentioned in the recording proved to be the dimensions of the original image. After multiplying the width and height with 3301 and using the product as a web address, users were taken to a website. The website consisted of a countdown as well as an image of a cicada. When the countdown reached zero, the page was updated with a list of coordinates. The coordinates pointed to locations around the globe. 14 locations in 5 different countries. It was now up to participants living near the specified coordinates to rise from their comfortable armchairs and venture outside. Those who believed Cicada to be the work of an organization now felt their beliefs had been justified. In their opinion, only some international collective possessed the means and resources to create a scavenger hunt of this magnitude. This was not the work of your average troll. No, this had to be something else. At each location was a poster with the cicada symbol and a QR code. ...on the bike shelter over here. See I got it... I got it right there. You can see the corners, I just kinda ripped it off. The codes linked to an image, the image contained a riddle, the riddle lead to a book, and the book lead to a website. But here, the puzzle took an unexpected turn. Only a select group of first arrivals to this website were accepted into the final stage of the puzzle. The site eventually closed down with the message: 'We want the best, not the followers.' The finalists were also warned not to collaborate with others nor to share the details of this private stage of the puzzle. Well, given that we know this, it's safe to say that not everyone heeded that warning. But those who did presumably advanced through the final stages before reaching the very end of the puzzle. After nearly a month of silence an image appeared on the subreddit announcing the conclusion of the puzzle and, just like that, the hunt was over. Cicada had supposedly found the 'highly intelligent individuals' they were looking for and whatever happened to them is a bit of a mystery but more on that in a moment. The lack of an explanation was perceived by many as confirmation that the puzzle had been nothing but a wild-goose chase intent on wasting everyones time. After all, questions raised by the original image remained unanswered. What was the puzzle for? Who was behind it? What happens when you reach the end? However, as it later turned out, this was only the beginning. Whomever was behind this intricate game had the foresight to include an authentication code known as a PGP signature along with every clue. This allowed users to verify that an image or message was actually from Cicada as opposed to some impostor seeking to derail or hijack the puzzle. Cicada had repeatedly warned of such 'false paths' and insisted that any message lacking a valid PGP signature should promptly be disregarded. That's why this image, posted exactly a year and a day after the first, provoked such a frenzy. After a year of lackluster imitations, this image finally matched the official PGP signature. Cicada was back and it was time for round two. The second puzzle was not too dissimilar from the first. The image enclosed a message, the message lead to a book, the book produced a link, and gradually the puzzle unfolded. At one point, a recording titled The Instar Emergence was uncovered. Another clue lead to a cryptic Twitter account which then lead to an image. The image proved vital to the progression of the puzzle but the inclusion of this runic alphabet would remain a mystery for quite some time. Much like the first puzzle the second swelled into the physical world when a list coordinates compelled participants to, once again, take to the streets in search of enigmatic posters. This time it was 8 locations in 4 different countries. But eventually the trail went cold once again. Another select group of first arrivals had been accepted into a final private stage of the puzzle. Unlike the first puzzle the second did not conclude with an official message from Cicada. The trail merely went cold and Cicada vanished once more leaving us no closer to an explanation. However, this was still not the end. At the beginning of 2014 it was time for round three. Once again the image enclosed a message, the message lead to a book, the book produced a link, and suffice it to say, it was more of the same. Except, this time, the puzzle seemed to revolve around a strange book. The book was titled Liber Primus, meaning First Book in Latin, and was evidently written by Cicada. The runic alphabet uncovered in 2013 finally made sense as the book was primarily written in runes. Even so, the meaning of the translated pages were cryptic at best. The book consisted of various philosophical and idealogical ideas and appeared to be their manifesto. Many have since compared the strange writings to that of a cult. Nevertheless, the book also comprised a myriad of clues and codes. For example, this page advised participants to seek out a website on the deep web but the site remains undiscovered. Another page lead to a website containing yet another recording titled Interconnectedness. However, a significant portion of the book has yet to be translated. The runic text on some of the pages appear to be obfuscated by layers of encryption that has yet to be decrypted. Of the 74 pages featuring runes, only 19 have been successfully translated. As 2015 came and went without the launch of a new puzzle, many came to suspect the Liber Primus had to be completed if Cicada was to return. This was more or less confirmed at the beginning of 2016 when Cicada encouraged a reexamination of the book. More than four years have now gone by with minimal progress and near complete silence from Cicada. Questions raised by the original image have gone ignored. What is the purpose of these puzzles? Who's behind them? What happens when you reach the end? When the initial image appeared on 4chan back in 2012 many assumed Cicada 3301 to be an alternate reality game designed by a corporation to promote a new service or product. For example, Microsoft developed an elaborate ARG back in 2001 to promote the film Artificial Intelligence and a similar viral marketing campaign was used to promote the release of Halo 2. But the release of subsequent puzzles and the complete lack of commercialization has more or less eliminated that possibility. If we choose to believe some of the leaked information from the private end-stage of each puzzle than we do gain some insight into who this group might be. For example, at the end of the first puzzle, finalists supposedly received this email. In it, Cicada describe themselves as an international group who believe that privacy is an inalienable right. The aim of each puzzle is to recruit like-minded individuals in an effort to develop privacy-conscious solutions. The email then concludes with three questions. The PGP signature, which would have confirmed the authenticity of the email, was conveniently removed by the leaker. If a version with a valid signature does exists online I was unable to find it. But regardless of it's legitimacy, I find this question a bit odd. It reads: 'Do you believe that information should be free?' Assuming the expected answer is yes then the very first sentence... 'DO NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION!' ...seems a bit hypocritical. While the idea of a secret society recruiting individuals by means of elaborate cryptographic puzzles may seem a bit absurd or even conspiratorial, it's not entirely unfounded. Corporations and governments alike have employed similar recruitment techniques since at least the second World War. In 2013, the British intelligence agency GCHQ launched a recruitment program known as 'Can You Find It?'. Participants had to decrypt a number of cryptograms hidden across the internet and those who managed to solve the entire puzzle were offered a prize or a position at the agency. Google did something similar with enigmatic billboards back in 2004 and the US Navy launched a near-identical project in 2014. Okay, but then, what about the recruits? Why have we not heard from these chosen few? Well, we have. It's just that separating a legitimate finalist from an impostor is virtually impossible. In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, two alleged winners of the first puzzle chronicled the events beyond the final stage. After receiving an email from Cicada they were taken to a forum on the dark web. Here, they could communicate with some twenty some odd recruits as well as a handful of established members of Cicada. They were told that Cicada 3301 had been founded by a group of friends who shared common ideals about security, privacy, and censorship. The goal was to work as a collective to develop software applications in line with that ideology. As friends recruited friends, this secret society quickly expanded into a decentralized international organization. The recruits were then tasked with developing software that fit the ideology of the group and members of Cicada would oversee their progress. But without the allure of a puzzle to be solved, the recruits quickly lost interest. By the end of 2012 all but one had left and a few months later the site was gone. They never heard from Cicada again. One of the two winners, named Marcus Wanner, later elaborated further in a video by YouTuber Nox Populi. Furthermore, Nox Populi himself claims to be a winner of the second puzzle so I reached out to him and this is some of what he had to say. After completing the final stages of the second puzzle Nox Populi received an invitation to join Cicada 3301. However, he was not invited to a website but was instead merely told to be patient. Then, around May of 2013, all communication with Cicada abruptly ceased. This was around the same time as when the website dedicated to the winners of the first puzzle was suddenly taken down. Nox Populi later contacted other winners of the second puzzle to compare notes and their experiences were identical. In his own words: 'All the stories were the same, we were invited to join 3301, then something happened and silence followed a request for patience.' Nox Populi suppose that roughly five others completed the second puzzle in contrast to the twenty-odd winners of the first. In regards to who or what Cicada is, Nox Populi believes they could be a remnant of the cypherpunk movement of the late 80s and 90s. Essentially a small group of activists advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies but he admits that there is no way to know for certain. If you want a far more comprehensive walkthrough of these puzzles as opposed to my brief overview, Nox Populi has produced a number of videos on his channel which I highly recommend. While these accounts cannot be verified they do make for a very compelling argument as to what Cicada is. A group of anonymous developers seeking to develop privacy-conscious applications by recruiting talented individuals via cryptographic puzzles. Sure, it is not nearly as exciting as a shadow government seeking world domination or any of the more fantastical theories but it is certainly more plausible. You have to keep in mind that no part of these puzzles would have required more than one person. The posters are often pointed to as evidence that this must be the work of some international organization but I beg to differ. I mean, right now, I could use any number of services to hire random persons around the globe to install posters for me. Although, given that no poster was located more than an hour away from an airport leads me to believe that one or multiple persons actually traveled to these locations. I mean, some of the posters were found within walking distance of an international airport. The fact is that anyone with a disposable income and enough time on their hands would be able to create the illusion of a vast secret network spanning the globe. Not saying that is the case with Cicada 3301 but it is nonetheless a possibility that cannot be discounted. With all of that being said, I personally think a loose-knit group of privacy-minded hobby-cryptographers to be the most plausible explanation. Cicada made their last public statement in April of 2017, merely warning against disinformation, but the current status of the third puzzle and the possibility of a fourth remains clouded in mystery.","In January 2012, an enigmatic puzzle, dubbed Cicada 3301, appeared on 4chan, starting with a hidden message in an image that led to a series of complex cryptographic challenges. Participants deciphered clues, leading to physical locations, QR codes, and further puzzles, culminating in private stages for select individuals. Despite the absence of clear answers about its purpose or creator, rumors emerged that Cicada aimed to recruit skilled individuals in cryptography and privacy. Over the years, the puzzles continued with similar patterns and obscure writings, notably a book, *Liber Primus*, in runes. After several years of inactivity, former participants suggested Cicada was a group focused on privacy and cryptography, but the true nature of the organization and the outcome of the puzzles remain a mystery."
"Here's what happens when you put your DNA under a microscope. You can extract some from your mouth, just gargle salt water and mix this with soap and rubbing alcohol. You'll get a gooey mass at the top. This is DNA. Most of it is yours, but some of it actually comes from bacteria living in your mouth. At 100 times magnification, you'll see these strings, which are coiled up DNA, proteins and debris, all clumped together. But looking at them is pretty much useless. I mean, even with a million dollar electron microscope, you can't actually see the genetic code that makes you you. So how do you read DNA? DNA. DNA evidence. DNA. Your family secrets. You are not the father. Diseases you haven't been diagnosed with yet. Predicting or even diagnosing cancers. The tiny quirks of what makes you you. But for the vast majority of human history, we have not been able to read it. It is completely illegible. All of this might still be impossible today, if not for one man who took a lot of drugs and stumbled upon a discovery that unlocked DNA forever. Also, he was kind of a jerk. In the 1960s as a biochemistry student at Berkeley, Kary Mullis wasn't interested in going to his classes. He was too busy taking LSD and lots of it. Mullis didn't take university very seriously. His PhD dissertation was filled with jokes and the committee refused to approve it until he, quote, cut all the wacko stuff out. But LSD fueled his eccentric genius, sparking all sorts of interesting ideas. It did trickle into his science. So for example, he wrote a letter to the journal Nature, which chronicled the, quote, entire universe from the beginning to the end, and they published it, which is amazing. He was like 22 years old, they published that. After graduating, Mullis just bummed around for a bit. First, he gets a job in a cardiology lab, but he's just kind of so horrified at how many rats are being killed. So he starts writing fiction, he gets a job in a bakery. One day he's working in this bakery, and this guy, Tom White, walks in and it turns out Tom White works at this company. It's a biotech startup called Cetus. They sort of get to talking, and this guy offers Kary Mullis, he offers him a job. White recommended Mullis to his higher-ups, saying 'Hire this guy Mullis, he's an excellent synthetic chemist. I knew he was a good chemist because he'd been synthesizing hallucinogenic drugs at Berkeley.' Cetus was one of the first biotech companies in the world. It was founded in 1971. An exciting time when scientists were starting to figure out how to manipulate DNA. One of the most important discoveries was actually made that year while researchers at Johns Hopkins were studying the bacteriophage. The phage is a virus that hijacks bacteria by injecting its DNA into the cell. The bacteria is then forced to create copies of the phage until it explodes. But the researchers realized that some bacteria evolved defenses that make them more resistant to the virus. Their defensive molecules would scan the phage DNA, looking for a specific sequence, and when they found a match, they would cut the DNA, turning it into useless strings. Scientists called these little scissor molecules restriction enzymes, and different types of restriction enzymes cut DNA at different places and they work on human DNA too. So the researchers extracted the enzymes to essentially create a toolbox of nanoscopic scissors that would allow them to cut DNA at will. Cetus was trying to use biotech like this to develop commercial DNA tests that hospitals could use to quickly diagnose diseases. But at the time, simple DNA tests like this were impossible. Say you want to detect sickle cell disease. I mean, you could just look at the blood cells under a microscope, but Cetus wanted to prove that they could do it with a genetic test. And for one of those, you would start off with a sample of DNA. In each of your cells, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, and if you zoom into the tip of the 11th chromosome, you'll find the beta globin gene. This sequence of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine nucleotides controls the shape of your red blood cells. And if you inherit a T instead of an A here from both of your parents, well, you're born with sickle cell anemia. But, you can't see any of this under a microscope. So how do you check these single letter mutations against DNA that's over six billion letters long? Mullis said that this was the equivalent to reading a license plate on interstate five in the dark from the Moon But luckily there was a way to do it. The first step is to separate the beta globin gene from the rest of the DNA. So you can use restriction enzymes on your sample to cut the DNA into little pieces, all of different lengths, and the sickle cell mutation will be on one of these ribbons. But how does that help? Well, DNA is negatively charged so if you place your cut up sample into a porous material like a gel and apply a voltage across it, the DNA pieces will flow from the negative end to the positive end. But because they're all different lengths, shorter pieces of DNA will navigate the gel pores quicker than longer ones. This is called gel electrophoresis, and it lets you separate DNA out by length. Its results are consistent enough that after the DNA is spread across the gel, you can see where different length strands end up. Near the start, you'll see DNA strands that are 10,000 base pairs followed by shorter ones, 3000, 1000, and so on. And because you used specific restriction enzymes, you can predict that the sickle cell mutation was sliced into a 2000 base pair segment. So it's in here. And now that we know where the target DNA is, we can move on to step two, checking whether our sample actually has that mutation or not. If you soak the sample in an alkaline solution or heat it up to over 90 degrees, the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides will break and the DNA will unzip. Now, the two strands will be able to pair to any other DNA as long as it's a match. As only pair to Ts and Gs only pair to Cs. You need a complimentary sequence. Scientists could take advantage of this by synthesizing short pieces of DNA in a lab. These are called probes, and they can be designed to have any specific sequence. So if the sickle cell mutation is CTGTG, you can create a probe that has the complimentary sequence, GACAC, that will stick to it. And because normal DNA is supposed to be CTGAG, your custom probe won't be a good match. Now, the trick is to make these synthetic probes radioactive and add them in. So after a while, your probes will either pair to the DNA or just keep floating around. And if you wash your sample, any probes that didn't pair will rinse off. So the final step is to check the sample for radioactivity. You can see that with sickle cell blood, there's a radioactive signal on the right. The probe found the mutation and stuck to it. But in the case of normal blood, there's no signal. None of the probes paired, so there must be no mutation. There is also this other huge signal in both cases. That's because the probes will match to other parts of the DNA too, not just to the sickle cell region. This is why you need to separate the mutation out using the gel first. This technique was known as the Southern Blot, and it worked, but there was a problem. It took days or even weeks. Every step of it is difficult and every step of it, it's like super inefficient. The matching is inefficient. The radio-sensitive paper is really inefficient, and you have these technicians having to work with radioactive stuff. And it happened in a way that it was so slow and cumbersome that it wasn't commercially feasible in any way. Cetus wanted a DNA test that could be done in a day in a single test tube, and they were close. They developed a method that could test for sickle cell disease in just seven hours. But this new test suffered from a different problem. The signal was just too faint. You could hardly tell whether the sample had the sickle cell mutation or not because it would barely return any results. Now, Kary Mullis didn't work on these cutting edge DNA tests. His job was to make those short radioactive bits of DNA that would be used as probes. He wasn't even doing the interesting part. So he's just making these snippets. That's his job, and it is a slow, repetitive, extremely boring job. So while he's working there, maybe in part because he is bored, he's just obnoxious, he's like a really annoying person. He doesn't get along with anybody. He picks fights with like receptionists and security guards and his colleagues. He also was a womanizer, so he would be hitting on people all the time, which was at the same time he was also married. There was one time where he threatened to bring a gun to work. Really like not someone you would wanna work with. But, one day they bring in this new machine into the workplace. This machine basically could synthesize these snippets all by itself. It's basically doing, you know, a month of his work in like a day. Mullis, he's like, now I both have free time and I have a lot of these little DNA snippets I can sort of play with and figure out like, what can I do with them? And now he doesn't really have a lot of work to do. And also people don't like him at work. So he basically starts taking weekends in Mendocino County to just relax. As he was driving up to his cabin on a Friday night in the spring of 1983, Mullis let his mind wander. He thought about that new DNA test and was trying to think of a way to fix it. Then a thought struck him. What if instead of inventing a more powerful telescope to read a single license plate from the Moon, he just created more of that same license plate. His mind raced. Mullis could see DNA chains floating all around him. 'Blue and pink images of electric molecules injected themselves between the mountain and my eyes.' He wasn't on LSD, but his mind by then had learned how to get there. He could sit on a DNA molecule watching the reactions unwind. See, the whole DNA sequence around the sickle cell mutation was known. And because Mullis knew one strand, by complementarity, he knew the other as well. So if he heated up the DNA and separated the strands, he could design short bits of DNA that would pair to both strands anywhere on the sequence. These would be his primers. Then, Mullis could use something called DNA polymerase. It's a special protein that attaches itself to sites like these where primers are paired to the original DNA. The polymerase basically grabs nucleotides floating around and extends the primer. And the primer is built as a perfect complimentary pair to the strand of DNA it's attached to. This creates an identical copy of the initial double helix. Polymerase exists in every cell of every living thing. It is what's responsible for replicating DNA during cell division. But it will only ever build out a primer in one direction. It's kind of like a one-way street. You see each DNA strand starts with a phosphate molecule. This is called the five prime end. That phosphate is attached to a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, which holds one of the four nucleotides. And deoxyribose also connects to the next phosphate, and so this pattern repeats. But the last deoxyribose molecule doesn't have another phosphate connected to it. So it ends with an OH group instead. This is the three prime end, our street exit. The three prime end on one DNA strand is always connected to the five prime end on the other. The second DNA strand always points the other way. And DNA polymerase needs an OH group to attach the next nucleotide. So it always builds on the three prime end. But that wasn't a limitation, it was an advantage, and Mullis knew exactly how to use it. He could create two primers that would bind to the DNA before the sickle cell mutation, each on a different strand pointing at each other. And if he added polymerase along with some spare nucleotides, it would have to extend both primers toward and over the sickle cell mutation. This would create two separate DNA segments, both with the mutation. A few miles down the road, he had another eureka. He could just do these three steps again, Unzip the DNA, pair the primers, and use polymerase to extend them. He now had four DNA sequences with the mutation and he could make that eight and then 16, 32, 64. And he realized that if he repeated this chain reaction 30 times, he would have over a billion copies of that specific DNA segment, all with the sickle cell mutation. He could cover the entire Earth with identical copies of the license plate. And if he designed different primers, he could change the length of the DNA section that would get replicated. This didn't only work for the sickle cell mutation. As long as you knew the sequence for any part of any DNA, human, plant, bacterial, you could make copies of that exact segment and the copies would grow exponentially, like a nuclear chain reaction. (upbeat music) Mullis had invented a DNA photocopier. He named it the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR for short. Immediately he stopped the car and scribbled his idea on the back of a gas receipt. PCR consumed his thoughts for the rest of the weekend. 'It was difficult for me to sleep with DNA bombs exploding in my brain. What if I had not taken LSD ever? Would I have invented PCR? I don't know. I doubt it. I seriously doubt it.' Monday morning, he bursts into the office at Cetus Corp, and he pitches his idea. He's like, basically, look, hey, I came up with a DNA Xerox machine. Like, we are working so hard to read this tiny tiny thing. What if we made a billion copies of it? It would be so much easier. Mullis presented his idea at a company-wide seminar,","Kary Mullis, a biochemist with unconventional habits and a controversial personality, developed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1983. While working at Cetus, he realized that instead of improving the ability to read small DNA segments, scientists could create billions of copies of a specific DNA sequence to make it more easily detectable. His breakthrough came after he envisioned using primers to replicate DNA exponentially. This invention revolutionized genetic testing and diagnostics, making it faster and more efficient, and is now a cornerstone of modern molecular biology."
"Here are two metal cylinders and a single drop of superglue. Once it sets, you can literally hang from that one drop of adhesive. Oh my God. That is crazy. So how is superglue so strong? Well, that's what I want to find out. And along the way, we're going to learn how it sets so quickly, why it's so good at sticking to skin, how it saves lives, and how it might even help solve our plastic pollution problem. Plus, if it's so strong, one single drop can easily lift over three tons. Why is it weak in certain circumstances? Mom is going to kill us. *scream* In 1942, the US was at war. And to accelerate the production of gun sights, the Eastman Kodak Company was looking for a clear plastic that could be cast instead of grinding glass lenses. Chemist Harry Coover was working on a compound called cyanoacrylate. It looked promising, but it had the unfortunate tendency to stick to everything it touched. Coover called it a severe pain. And as the war wound down, Kodak gave up on finding a plastic replacement and kept on making gun sights out of glass. By 1951, Coover was again trying to develop a clear plastic. This time for jet plane canopies. If he could just solve the stickiness problem, cyanoacrylate could work. Coover showed the material to his coworker Fred Joyner, but gave him strict instructions. I told him, look, don't take a refractive index of this material. If you do, you're going to wreck the refractometer. Cos it’s going to stick it together. But after testing 909 other compounds, Joyner had forgotten. So he prepped the 910 test by smearing cyanoacrylate between two prisms. After taking the measurement, Joyner discovered he couldn't pull the prisms apart. He panicked. The refractometer, worth nearly $10,000 adjusted for inflation, was ruined. But instead of getting angry, Coover had a flash of insight. He got a sample of cyanoacrylate and began gluing together anything within reach. Glass plates, rubber stoppers, metal spatulas, wood, paper, in all different combinations. He said “Everything stuck to everything almost instantly and with bonds I could not break apart.” With this discovery, he dubbed the compound Eastman 910 Adhesive, as it was the 910th substance tested in the company's search. But nowadays, everyone calls this super glue. So how does it work so quickly with such strength on so many different things? Bonds almost anything. A plastic knob, a plastic plug, a rubber boot, a metal brooch, a fishing rod, a cycle grip, model planes and model trains, a doorknob screw, a flashlight case, the broken trim on any car. Super glue in the tube is a liquid of identical monomer molecules. The molecule is ethyl cyanoacrylate. When you put it between two surfaces, the liquid flows into all the pores and crevices. Then the monomers start reacting with each other, joining to form long polymer chains. This turns the glue from a liquid into a solid, and at this point it can no longer be pulled out of the cracks and crevices, so it's stuck in place and the two surfaces are connected. If you're ever trying to glue surfaces that are too smooth, this is probably the reason super glue sticks poorly. There are few crevices or pores for it to cling to. To fix this, you can sand the surfaces to introduce some surface texture. That way when the liquid glue solidifies, it's stuck in the cracks. But what triggers the monomers to solidify instead of staying liquid like they are in the tube? Well, ethyl cyanoacrylate is primed to react because it has two double bonds and one triple bond close together. What makes it so reactive is you have a double bond attached to a nitrile group and an ester group. And the unique part about that is the chemistry of those groups that make that double bond so electron deficient. The oxygen and the nitrogen atoms attract electrons more than the carbons. So that leaves this carbon slightly positively charged. It is hungry. It is looking. And anything even slightly electronegative, it will attack and it'll start a reaction. In the presence of a negative ion, the carbon double bond breaks and four single bonds form. But the nitrile and ester groups are so electronegative they pull the extra electron on across the molecule, making this carbon negative. That invites another slightly positive carbon on a separate monomer to attack. And now they're chemically linked together. The start of a polymer chain. And once that goes now it has the ability to go react with all those other super glue hungry monomers and rapidly polymerize. It's a really, really chemically reactive species. That single initiator started a chain reaction. The next monomer again pulls across the electron and more and more monomers bond together, forming longer and longer chains until the super glue has solidified. It normally takes between 10 and 30 seconds to set. This was much faster than other adhesives available in the 1950s. A lot of glues like white glue and glue sticks work by drying out, so you have to wait for the water to evaporate. But with super glue it's almost the opposite. While I was prototyping snatoms, I 3D printed these plastic shells and super glued them together. One day I was trying to open a bottle of super glue where the cap had gotten glued on to the nozzle, so I tried twisting it off with my teeth, but the bottle exploded, filling my mouth with super glue. And I was thinking, well, I might have a few seconds to spit it out with the saliva in my mouth before it set. But the super glue actually hardened immediately. It stuck to my teeth and my tongue. I had to get my now wife to pick it out of my teeth with tweezers. Luckily, it didn't glue together anything essential. I think it's because it solidified so rapidly. And the reason it did that is because the polymerization of super glue is actually triggered by water. Specifically, it's the slightly negative oxygen atoms in the polar water molecule and the negative hydroxide ions in water that often break open the carbon double bond, initiating the formation of chains. And water is everywhere. I mean, there's moisture in the air, little bits of water on most surfaces, or absorbed into materials like fabrics. That's why super glue sets rapidly on almost every surface. Each water molecule can initiate the formation of a polymer chain. There's a forensic technique that uses super glue fumes to pull fingerprints from non-porous surfaces. When you grab something, your hand leaves behind moisture and oils that are perfect for super glue to bind with. And this also makes skin ideal to stick to. There are a lot of wrinkles and pores for super glue to seep into. Plus, the protein collagen has a number of negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reaction and bond directly with a monomer. So your skin is the perfect sort of surface for super glue to stick to. And that's why it's so hard to get off. Some of your molecules literally become part of the polymer chain. There's a medical case study where someone got cyanoacrylate all over his hands. So he quickly went to wash it off with soap and water. But that accelerated the polymerization reaction, and his hands were stuck together. So he went to multiple medical professionals, and he got terrible advice. They tried alcohol, water and soap. They also attempted physical separation. And he went to consult cosmetic surgery. But finally someone suggested acetone. Acetone, or nail polish remover, dissolved the glue and released his hands. Now, unfortunately, the bottles for some types of super glue look incredibly similar to those for eyedrops. So there are hundreds of cases of people putting super glue directly into their eyes. In that case, acetone is not the solution. Don't try to separate your eyelids, just seek medical attention. Super glue is strong. To demonstrate this and promote his new product, Coover went on a game show. He showed that with only a single drop of glue, he could lift himself and the host into the air. Here we go. One drop of glue. And after 24 hours, it would support something like 15,000 pounds. One drop of glue. Now, doctor, you must be very proud of this. I imagine many years of research went into its discovery. No, as a matter of fact, it wasn't Gary. This discovery was purely by accident. Bully for you. Super glue polymers are almost all single chains running linearly between the surfaces. They have a directionality to them, kind of like wood grain. The chains are densely packed with some cross-linking between them, and this makes the polymer fairly rigid. It's about as hard as a hard hat. This makes it strong in compression. Under tension, super glue is strongest when you pull in the same direction as the chains. The tensile strength of super glue can be upwards of 25 mega pascals, which is similar to other polymers, meaning a square patch just five centimeters on a side could suspend a fully grown African elephant. But super glue also has its weaknesses. It is brittle, so if there's a sudden impact, it just kind of falls apart. As a super glue is very quickly reacting. It usually produces really short polymer chains that have a matrix with built in stress. Any time you have stress in a material, it's a potential failure point. The thing that makes it a really good adhesive is kind of its Achilles heel. in some cases. Polyethylene, polypropylene, nylons, like those squishy plastics. Their polymer chains and their chemistry are such that they can absorb a lot of impact. If a force comes in, they'll kind of deform. Whereas in the chains of a super glue polymer, it doesn't have the ability to do that. So any impact will come and it'll physically break those rigid bonds. And it'll also kind of be absorbed in those stress points, and it'll cause the whole thing to fracture. Super glue is also weak if a force is applied perpendicular to the polymer chains. That is, it's weak in shear. During this shear test, the stress releases breaking the super glue bond. So shear is kind of a combination of forces. So you kind of have like a compression and like a friction going on. Tension is a pretty uni-directional force. And the polymer chains are able to deform enough. However, in shear you have a more dynamic set of forces going on. And and they're just kind of breaking up all at once. Shear force doesn't get spread evenly. It's highest at the edges and lower in the middle. And since super glue is so brittle, it can't redistribute this stress, causing the bond to fail. It's even worse if you grab one end of a surface and try to peel it back. In that case, all that force is on a few polymers, so the chains break one by one like a zipper unzipping. Two long bars super glued together could be strong since there's a lot of surface area. But if one end breaks, the rest can easily peel off. Now a bond breaking is bad, but there are some materials that super glue won't even stick to at all. So here we have a milk bottle, and this is made out of a plastic called polyethylene. I'm going to put one drop right here. But it's so weak you can see the glue has made a perfect little film and it doesn't stick whatsoever. The materials that super glue does not bond to. They fall in to category of materials that are known as chemically inert. And by inert it just means that they don't have reactive sites. So super glue is so reactive because it is so electron deficient. It's looking for any source of electrons. But you have a polypropylene or a polyethylene or a Teflon. And carbon loves carbon, and carbon is not sharing its electrons. So there's nothing on the surface that is willing to donate any reactivity. Even if you add initiators, say, by spraying water, it still doesn't work. That's because these materials are hydrophobic and non-porous. If you spray like, a polypropylene sheet, with water it'll just fall off, right? You know, if you can think of, like, the beating up of water on a hydrophobic surface. So if you pour super glue on top of water, it'll just like, you'll just get like a clump of super glue on it. And then you can just peel it off. Most super glue specifically warns against using it on polyethylene and polypropylene because it won't stick. But this is actually a good thing. You have to have something that super glue won't stick to, so it can be contained and stored without setting. Super glue quickly found industrial applications. Its first sale was to Mason and Hanger in 1956, who used it to assemble atomic bombs. Soon, different additives were devised to change the properties of pure ethyl cyanoacrylate. The monomers by themselves are very runny, almost like water, so companies added thickening agents like fumed silica to turn it into a gel. Fumed silica forms branched structures that increase viscosity. Some acid is often added to inhibit polymerization in the tube. If you want to speed up the setting of super glue, one way is to add more negative ions, the initiators that start the polymerization reaction. You can buy accelerators specifically for this purpose off the shelf, but a number of DIYers and handymen use baking soda - sodium bicarbonate. It reacts with moisture in the air to produce hydroxide ions. So when you add super glue, it sets even faster due to all those ion initiators. Plus, it forms a really hard composite substance. You can layer super glue and baking soda to strengthen a joint and fill gaps. It can even be drilled or sanded after setting. It's interesting to see how baking soda in solution speeds up the polymerization of super glue. If you take pure water and pour in super glue, you get a bunch of little plastic droplets. The glue sets quickly, but not fast enough to keep the whole stream connected. But with baking soda dissolved in the water, the super glue sets even faster. This creates a continuous length of polymer, which is really cool to see, but the resulting plastic is fragile and can easily be crushed. If you wanna glue things underwater with superglue, the key is actually to slow the polymerization down. With a gel cyanoacrylate, the thickeners slow the reaction, giving you enough time to apply and detach objects. - Wow, there it is: glued underwater. It's","Superglue, discovered accidentally by Harry Coover in the 1950s, is a powerful adhesive made from ethyl cyanoacrylate, which polymerizes rapidly when exposed to moisture, creating strong bonds on various surfaces. It works by linking monomers into long polymer chains, solidifying within seconds, and is effective on porous materials due to its reactivity with water. Its strength lies in the linear structure of its polymer chains, which can support substantial weight, but it is brittle and weak under impact or shear stress. Superglue is ineffective on chemically inert materials like polyethylene and polypropylene, and various additives can alter its properties, including accelerators like baking soda for faster setting."
"Here we are in the Faroes, a remote community up at the North Atlantic. We have been living on fishing for hundreds of years. We have no production of chemicals, but we are exposed to a lot of chemicals. They came to us without asking us. We have seen negative effects on the health of our children. We want to see their development because we always have been a bit suspicious if these substances can have any impact on the endocrine system. This is the price to pay for what the international society have done without thinking about the consequences of just releasing new substances. What we have seen here in the Faroes is that this is part of a absolutely global contamination that may have started in the 1960s, without us being aware of it. The PFAS is everywhere. PFAS have contaminated our food supply, and PFAS can also accumulate in soils, in sediments. The chemists who have sampled rainwater on the Antarctica and in the Himalayas, what do they find in the rainwater? PFAS. It's all over. They don't just stay in the environment, in our water, in our soil, but they get into living things, and they stay in us. It's like a ticking time bomb in the body, as this stuff is building up and coating all of our organs and staying there year after year. We have analyzed thousands and thousands of human blood samples. We never met one that did not contain PFAS. We have all paid a high price due to large corporations carelessly dumping known toxic chemicals. Through no fault of my own, I was exposed to these toxic chemicals, and as a result, I will die with this cancer. We've all been used as guinea pigs for the last 70 to 80 years. We weren't told we were being exposed, even though the companies knew that these things, if we put them into these products, they will get into people. They will get into people's blood. But they did it anyway. It's hard to even talk to people about these chemicals and tell them, look, there's a chemical that's in you that's not found anywhere in nature. These chemicals are found in 99% of people. It just sounds crazy. Tell people that these are also forever chemicals, that we've created a chemical that we don't know how to destroy, it sounds even stranger. So PFAS are synthetic, man-made chemicals. PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. It's quite a mouthful. It's an acronym that stands for a family of thousands of different chemicals. The most recent estimate from the EPA says that there are over 14,000 different chemical structures that they recognize to be PFAS. They share the same chemical property of having many carbon-fluorine bonds. These carbon-fluorine bonds are some of the strongest bonds in organic chemistry. So for this reason, PFAS have also been called 'forever chemicals,' because those carbon-fluorine bonds just really don't break down. But the part where this story gets really strange is looking at their origins, because these chemicals came from the Manhattan Project, which was a secret project to build the atomic bomb in World War II. So after the war, companies began experimenting with these chemicals. One company had a scientist who accidentally splashed some of it on their canvas shoes. They discovered the chemicals had stain-proof and water-proof properties. That company was 3M. Because of their unique chemical properties, they're added to products to make them non-stick, greaseproof, stainproof, and water resistant. You know who's going to win this contest. Teflon is so much easier to clean than stainless steel or uncoated aluminum. These chemicals went into some of these company's most famous products, like 3M's Scotchgard and DuPont's Teflon. These chemicals were really at the dawn of what we think of as the era of better living through chemistry, and they sort of epitomized this attitude of consumers and companies that everything we do could become more convenient. ... on virtually any fabric! Use Scotchgard fabric protector and let your cup runneth over. And consumers are still really enjoying the fruits of this era. When you look around you, there are so many things that are stainproof or waterproof, like pizza boxes that are grease-resistant or microwave popcorn bags. They're in industrial applications like plastics, semiconductors. They may even be used in solar panels and wind turbines. They're in a lot of products that it's not even clear why they're there, like toilet paper or dental floss. But as time has gone on and more scientific research into them has progressed, we've realized that they also have a downside. We're east of Minneapolis in Minnesota, near 3M's global headquarters. So back in 2018, I started looking at 3M's history with PFAS chemicals. I wrote a story at that time. A lot has changed since then and I'm back to see what's happened. In 3M's hometown in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and in these surrounding areas of Oakdale and Lake Elmo, the company had been dumping these chemicals since the 1960s. And clearly these chemicals got out into the environment, they were seeping underground, getting into aquifers, getting into soil, and that's really the beginning of this gigantic plume that was later documented around the 3M site in Cottage Grove. The pollution has caused concern among the people who live in the area. There are troubling statistics about childhood cancer, which is thought to be more connected to environmental contaminants. Hi. Hi, how's it going? Hi. How are those burgers? Great! I'm a wonderful barbecuer, obviously. Do you have a plate to put them on? That probably would've been something I should have grabbed as well. Oh my gosh, mother. I have the other. Back in 2018 I interviewed a number of local residents, including Amy and her daughter Lexi. I was so happy to get back in touch with you and find out that Lexi has made a full recovery. So how many years did that take and- Being like, done with treatment and stuff to be fully like, considered cancer-free, it took five years after I was treated for it. So when did you first start suspecting that it could be an environmental issue? I drank city water growing up, so City of Oakdale Water. And then when I was pregnant with Lexi, her dad and I moved into an apartment in Oakdale and lived there until she was about two or three and all of her baby bottles were made with the water. We didn't buy the filtered water then. I don't think it was like, as common as it is now. Like, to me, I don't really remember people as having bottles of water. It was more of a luxury. People didn't wanna spend money on that. I mean, do you ever think back about, like, eating fish from the lake or anything else that might've put her at higher risk? Yeah, so- I've been eating fish since like, the day I was like, one years old. Like, since the day I could chew my grandpa has been having me eat fish. From the lakes around here? Yeah. So my dad, her grandpa, he's a professional fishing guide. Oh wow. So he loves the fish, and he loves to go fishing and come home and make big fish fries. And yeah, they live right over by here. It's about a six-minute drive from here. So all the lakes that he would go to would be Lake Demontreville, Lake Jane, all the ones in Lake Elmo. My dad's a lot more particular now if he's gonna actually keep them. Not everyone was as fortunate as Lexi. Death records show a child who died in Oakdale from 2003 to 2015 was 171% more likely to have had cancer compared to those who lived outside the contaminated area. So in that area, one of the schools was Tartan High School. And there was a math teacher there who told me the numbers just weren't adding up. There were so many students who seemed to have rare cancers, so many teachers who had family members with cancer. And one of the most outspoken students about this was Amara Strande. I'm 20 years old, and at the age of 15, I was diagnosed with stage four fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. I've had over 20 surgeries, including two liver resections and one open chest surgery. There are no more treatments to try, no roadmap, and no plan. So is this her bedroom- Bedroom. or just her hangout? No, this is her bedroom. No, this was her bedroom. The reason why there's no bed in here is because it was a hospital bed, and we had to give that back to- The hospice. It's from hospice. Yeah. Amara was diagnosed with cancer at age 15 and she died just two days before her 21st birthday in April of 2023. What she's most proud of is- Her music studio. Her music studio. Wow, how many different instruments does she have in here? I see a violin. There's a ukulele, her mandolin. There might be a harmonica or a kazoo somewhere in there. Her first love was music. She was a composer. She had written songs. Her dream of a career was to write music, compose music for either computer games or maybe even film scores. And she could keep composing even while she was sick? She was composing up until just a few days before she died. Yeah. But she couldn't sing anymore. They removed this large mass that had grown into the fibers of her liver, of the fibrolamellar variety of liver cancer. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer that is found in one in five million people. It's very rare. Did any doctors along the way say they thought there might be an environmental cause for the cancer or suggest any lifestyle changes? That was not their concern. Their concern was to deal with the cancer as they understood it. It wasn't until much later that Amara started inquiring about, how possibly could this happen to her? And did she first start asking those questions at all because she was a student at Tartan and there have been so many other cancers there? Absolutely. I mean, she was aware of the community concern about PFAS. It was something that the kids talked about at school and even joked about, you know, as much as you can joke about, you know, 'Don't drink the water here.' 'Don't drink the cancer water.' Yeah. As they talked about it. She knew kids whose parents had cancer, and then she knew kids whose siblings had cancer. She wanted to know, why doesn't anyone know about this? Why aren't people asking questions? Even though Amara and Lexi's mother Amy believe that these cancers are linked to PFAS chemicals, it's something that's very hard to prove. It takes years of research both on a population level and in particular when you look at one individual. But fears about the water intensified by what would come out in the 2010s. Minnesota sued 3M for damaging the state's natural resources with its dumping of PFAS, and in doing so, a mass of the company's internal documents were released. What they revealed has been described as a scientific cover up. Seeing the documents that in 1975, 3M was told, we think we're finding your chemicals, these perfluorinated materials, in the blood of the general US population. And to see what was going on internally, you know, 3M started testing its own workers and found, yes, this chemical is building up in the workers who were exposed to this chemical. They were seeing studies of these chemicals on animals with disturbing effects. It shows that in 1997, 3M gave DuPont a material safety data sheet with a label that said: 'Cancer: Warning: contains a chemical which can cause cancer.' But 3M removed that label the same year and for decades sold PFAS without warning the public of its dangers. You see the companies internally debating. Do we say anything? Do we tell the government? And unfortunately what they decided was, no. Some of 3M's documents even showed that there had been a sort of whistleblower inside the company named Richard Purdy who had said the company wasn't telling its customers about the risks of these chemicals, and he resigned. He referred to 3M's PFOS, or P-F-O-S, as the most insidious pollutant since PCBs, Some of the most notorious PFAS are PFOS and PFOA. So these are two PFAS molecules that have a carbon backbone with eight carbon atoms. These are the chemicals that so far have raised the greatest concern. These are the ones that show up most frequently in the environment. These are also the ones that show up most frequently in people's bodies. They have half lives in blood of years, which means that it would take years to decades for the levels in your blood to go down to an unmeasurable level. The 3M company had actually had one of its own scientists sit down and calculate what would be a safe level in human blood, and that scientist had calculated, and they even used the word 'safe' on the headline of the document, that the safe level for this chemical in human blood would be no more than 1.05 parts per billion. At the time, in the late 1990s, the average level of that chemical being found in the general US population's blood was 30 times higher than that. In 2018 3M settled, but there was no admission that it had done anything wrong, that there had been a scientific cover up, or what the real risk of these chemicals was. 3M will pay 850 million dollars to settle claims it contaminated water in Minnesota for decades. It's hard to talk about in our community because, like, everyone loves 3M, right? There's not a person I know personally from 3M who isn't a stellar individual. I feel torn inside myself, but I am really angry at whoever, at whatever level did what they did, especially after they knew the chemicals were dangerous and they kept doing it. So no one even knew what these chemicals were until this lawyer from Ohio came along. His name is Rob Bilott, and he took on the case of a farmer who had these cows downstream of a DuPont factory that were dying. It's unbelievable. That calf has died miserable. And so Rob Bilott's story is now told in the film 'Dark Waters,' where he's played by Mark Ruffalo. DuPont is knowingly poisoning 70,000 local residents for the last 40 years. That's not what I was trained to do. That wasn't the kind of thing I was normally doing at the time. I was actually working with chemical companies and big corporate clients, helping them navigate all the federal, state, international laws, rules, regulations, governing things","PFAS chemicals, initially linked to the Manhattan Project, became widely used in consumer products like Teflon and Scotchgard due to their water- and stain-resistant properties. However, their environmental and health impacts were not disclosed, leading to widespread contamination. These chemicals have accumulated in the global ecosystem, affecting water, soil, and living organisms, with harmful effects on human health, including cancers and endocrine disruption. Despite evidence of toxicity and corporate cover-ups, companies like 3M continued producing and distributing PFAS without proper warnings. Legal battles and scientific revelations have exposed the risks, but many communities remain unaware or misinformed about the dangers."
"One single scientist created three inventions that accidentally caused the deaths of millions of people, including himself. Not only that, they decreased the average intelligence of people all around the world, increased crime rates, and caused two completely separate environmental disasters that we are still dealing with today. Part of this video is sponsored by Wren. More about them at the end of the show. In 1944, as a young chemist who had just finished his Master's, Clair Patterson went to work on the Manhattan Project, building the first nuclear weapons. His job was to concentrate uranium-235, the fissile fuel for bombs from the much more common uranium-238. And this required huge machines, mass spectrometers, which separated the two types of uranium by their slight difference in mass. After the war, Patterson went back to grad school to get his PhD, he picked a research project that would take advantage of his experience with mass spectrometers: measuring the age of the Earth. Radioactive rocks are effectively clocks. Uranium-238, for example, decays into thorium and then protactinium, and then 12 More decays until it ends up as lead-206, which is stable. The rate of this decay is consistent and can be measured. It takes four and a half billion years for half of a sample of U-238. to decay into lead-206 Patterson's PhD project was to determine the age of the Earth by measuring the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks, but to calibrate his instrument, first he used zircon crystals whose ages were known. Zircon is ideal for this purpose, because when it forms it contains trace amounts of uranium but absolutely no lead. So any lead that you later find inside a zircon, you know must be the product of a uranium decay. Patterson was tasked with measuring the lead content, and another student, George Tilton, measured uranium Tilton 's uranium measurements were fine. They matched predictions. But Patterson's lead measurements were all over the place. And they were many many times higher than they expected. We'd take George's uranium and my lead... Not right Patterson! There was lead there that didn't belong there. So where was all this extra lead coming from? That mystery would take over the rest of Clair Patterson's life and bring him to the literal ends of the earth. In 1908, a woman was driving across the Belle Isle bridge in Detroit. When her car stalled. A passing motorist stopped to help. In those days cars needed to be hand cranked to start. He knelt down and turned the crank, and the engine roared to life. A little too suddenly. The man couldn't get out of the way. The crank handle hit him in the face and broke his jaw. He died as a result of his injuries. His name was Byron Carter, and he was the founder of his own car company. So he was well connected in the Detroit Auto scene. He counted among his close friends, the founder of Cadillac, Henry Leland. Leland was so distraught over his friend's death that he resolved to eliminate hand cranks from his vehicles. Leland hired Charles Kettering to create a self- starting car. And by 1911, he had a working prototype. Hand cranking was difficult and dangerous, and best left to men, but a car that started itself changed everything. The world's first crankless car was the Cadillac Model 30. It was much more powerful than cars before it. It had a top speed of 45 miles per hour and 40 horsepower, double the Ford Model T. The Model 30 was a huge success for Cadillac, doubling the company's annual sales, but it had a problem. It was deafeningly loud. In internal combustion engines a piston compresses the fuel-air mixture, which is then ignited by a spark from the spark plug. The expanding hot gases push the piston back down. The problem with the Model 30 engine was it compressed the fuel-air mixture more than previous models so much in fact, that often the fuel would spontaneously combust before the spark from the spark plug. So rather than orderly, perfectly timed explosions, you'd get multiple haphazard combustions leading to turbulent pressure waves inside the cylinder. The resulting sound led the problem To become known as engine knocking. Knocking wasn't just hard on the ears, it hurt the engine's performance, it reduced power output and lowered fuel efficiency. The vibrations also damaged the piston and walls of the cylinder shortening the life of the engine. The good news was that engine knocking could be corrected by changing the fuel. Different fuels can withstand different levels of compression before detonating n-heptane for example, will spontaneously combust under only a little compression. Iso-octane, on the other hand can withstand a much higher compression ratio before it auto ignites. So it's much less likely to cause knocking. To quantify how much compression a fuel can withstand scientists came up with the octane rating system, they arbitrarily set iso-octane to have a rating of 100 and n-heptane a rating of zero. Now real fuels aren't made up of only these two ingredients. They're a mix of lots of different hydrocarbons. But the octane rating tells you what mixture of octane and heptane gives equivalent performance. For example, 98 octane fuel can withstand the same compression as a mixture of 98% octane and 2% heptane. Now, I'm going to take a little bit of 98 octane fuel and put it in this piston. And when I compress it, nothing happens which is exactly what you'd expect. This fuel can withstand a lot of compression. Diesel has an octane rating of 20. So it acts like a mixture of 20% iso-octane and 80% n-heptane. If I put a little bit of diesel in there, let's see what happens with the same compression ratio. There you go. You get a little explosion in there. That's because this is a low octane fuel. I mean, that's what diesel is meant to do. You compress it and it ignites. But you don't want this sort of fuel in an engine with spark plugs. The reason fancy cars demand high octane fuel is to prevent knocking in their high-compression high-performance engines. Kettering wanted to find an additive which would increase the octane rating of ordinary fuel and eliminate knocking in high-compression engines. So he hired a 27-year-old engineer Thomas Midgley Jr. Midgley experimented with all sorts of compounds from melted butter and camphor, to ethyl acetate and aluminum chloride. He later wrote, most of them had no more effect than spitting in the Great Lakes. Ethanol was an interesting exception, it did stop the knocking, but you needed a lot of it about 10% of the fuel mixture for it to be effective, that much ethanol would be expensive and hard to turn a profit on. And Midgley was really after an additive that was cheap, easy to produce and effective even at low concentrations. So he kept trying. Then he hit on tellurium. It worked wonderfully as an anti knock agent, but it had a terrible smell. You couldn't get rid of it by changing clothes or bathing. His wife was so offended by the stench that he had to sleep in the basement for seven months, Midgley wrote, I don't think that although this doubled the fuel economy, humanity would suffer this smell. On December 3 1921, after five years of working on the problem, Midgley found what he thought was the perfect solution, tetraethyl lead. That's a lead atom right there in the center. This additive was exactly what he was looking for. It stopped the knocking, it didn't smell. It was cheap to produce and readily available. Best of all, you only needed one part in 1000, for it to be effective. In a call to Kettering, Midgley said, can you imagine how much money we're going to make with this? We're going to make $200 million, maybe even more. That is over 3 billion in today's dollars. Now for his discovery, the American Chemical Society gave him the prestigious Nichols award, and they asked him to do a series of public talks, but Midgley declined. He and Kettering patented the process for making Tetra ethyl led, and they called their new additive Ethyl, perhaps so it might be confused with another common additive ethyl alcohol they made no mention of lead. Then they teamed up with three of America's largest corporations General Motors, DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation. Their marketing was brilliant. No man can look at the amazing record of accomplishment here in this research division, without confidence that these men are going ahead with an eye to the future, looking for new facts and principles, which will make things better and make life easier for all of us. at the 1923 Indianapolis 500, the top three finishers all used Ethyl and the demand for leaded gasoline took off. To keep up Ethyl Corporation had to build a new chemical plant in New Jersey. But the project began terribly. Within two months of operating, dozens of workers fell ill with lead poisoning. Five of them died. To address the public outcry, Midgley held a press conference. And there he poured Tetraethyl lead onto his hands, and he inhaled it for a full minute. He claimed he could do this daily without harm. But Midgley knew the dangers. The reason he had turned down the public talks was because he spent much of 1923 in Florida, where he himself was recovering from lead poisoning. He didn't go anywhere near his company's product if he could help it. Lead is dangerous even in small doses, it mimics calcium in our bodies, so there's no efficient way to get rid of it. And like calcium lead can be stored in bones for years, meaning it can continue to poison the body long after the initial exposure. The organ most sensitive to lead is the brain. Lead breaks down the myelin sheath around axons and prevents the release of neurotransmitters. That's why common symptoms of lead poisoning are headaches, memory loss and tingling in the hands and feet. And children are particularly susceptible, lead exposure can cause permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems, and the dangers of lead had been known for hundreds of years. Already in 1786, Benjamin Franklin remarked that lead had been used for far too long considering its known toxicity, 'you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on'. He would have been aghast to learn that nearly 150 years later, scientists planned to add lead to fuel. Doctors and public health officials from MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the US health service, wrote to Midgley and warned them against producing Tetraethyl lead. They called lead a creeping and malicious poison and a serious menace to public health. Their concerns were dismissed. This model shows how just the right amount of fluid containing Tetraethyl lead and dye is added to the gasoline. No one doubted that a lot of lead was bad for you. But how much harm could a little lead do? By the 1950s, millions of motorists globally were burning lead in their cars and releasing it into the air. Some of that lead ended up on Clair Patterson's zircon on samples, preventing him from determining their age. In 1952, he moved to Caltech, where he built a new lab from scratch, suspicious of environmental contamination, he tore the electrical cables out of the walls to remove the lead solder. He cleaned the floors and benches daily with ammonia and made sure that air was always being blown out of the lab. To go inside, you had to wear a plastic bunny suit. Patterson basically invented the cleanroom. Inside that room, he turned his attention to the oldest rocks in the solar system. meteorites. All the original rocks on Earth had long since been destroyed by tectonic activity. But meteorites come from asteroids which formed around the same time as Earth. They have just been drifting through space until they entered the Earth's atmosphere. So the best way to measure the age of the Earth was to measure the age of meteorites. Patterson measured five meteorites, each with three different radiometric dating techniques, and he found they were all 4.55 billion years old. That number is within 0.15% of the currently accepted value for the age of the earth. You know, before Patterson's experiment, people thought the earth was a billion years younger. So Patterson had done it. He measured the age of the Earth, but he wasn't done getting rid of lead contaminants. Public concern about lead exposure had continued to grow. But President of Standard Oil, Frank Howard pushed back saying, 'We do not feel justified in giving up what has come to the industry like a gift from heaven, on the possibility that a hazard may be involved in it.' Scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation claimed that lead was a natural part of our environment, and therefore not harmful to people. But Patterson wondered just how natural is the lead in our environment, and he had just the skills to find out. He began by measuring lead in the oceans. If it were natural, he expected the concentration of lead to be the same regardless of depth. But if lead pollution had increased recently, it would be more concentrated near the surface. He took samples in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans down to a depth of four kilometers. And sure enough, lead concentrations were nearly 10 times higher near the surface. Lead pollution was clearly recent, but when exactly had it occurred? To find out Patterson had to go to Greenland and Antarctica. Ice cores record the level of lead in the air going back 1000s of years, the levels of lead in the atmosphere have been elevated for the last 4500 years. All of it is due to human activity mainly smelting ores to make metal. You can see the rise and fall of the Greek and Roman Empires. The dip caused by the Black Death in the 1300s. And of course, the spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and Tetraethyl lead. So what did this do to people? Well, Patterson looked at the lead levels in the teeth and bones of recently deceased Americans. And for comparison, he measured the lead in bones and teeth of Peruvian and Egyptian mummies. Since they lived over 1600 years ago, they would have been exposed to much less lead in their lifetimes. He expected to find modern Americans had about 100 times as much lead in their bones. But results showed it was closer to a factor of 1,000. 20th century Americans had 1000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors. Studies of baby teeth revealed that even","Clair Patterson, a chemist involved in the Manhattan Project, made three inventions that led to significant global consequences. His work on mass spectrometers helped him determine the age of the Earth, but in the process, he discovered that lead contamination, primarily from the widespread use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline, was causing severe environmental and health damage. Lead exposure, particularly from burning leaded gasoline, increased crime, decreased intelligence, and contributed to widespread environmental pollution, with concentrations particularly high in oceans and ice cores. Despite warnings from scientists, the widespread use of lead persisted, causing harm to public health, particularly in children."
"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com. So, I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost. The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always count on YouTube monetization. So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after","Fritz Haber, awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, revolutionized global food production with his development of the Haber process, which allowed for the mass production of ammonia, a key fertilizer, helping sustain over 4 billion people today. However, his legacy is controversial due to his role in World War I, where he applied his chemical expertise to produce explosives and chemical weapons, including chlorine gas. While his scientific contributions saved countless lives through increased agricultural output, his involvement in the war and subsequent use of chemistry for destruction tarnished his reputation, leading to personal and professional isolation."
"J. Robert Oppenheimer might be the most important physicist to have ever lived. He never won a Nobel Prize, but he changed the world more than most Nobel Prize winners. Under his leadership, the best physicists of the 20th century built the atomic bomb forever changing the course of history. - If there is another world war, this civilization may go under. - [Derek] He has affected every war waged and every peace settled since the end of World War ii. He also created a way for humanity to destroy itself. - Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. - [Derek] This video is about how to build an atomic bomb, the life of Oppenheimer, and why serious scientists were worried about the explosion setting fire to the atmosphere, ending all life on earth. Part of this video is brought to you by Wren. When J. Robert Oppenheimer was 21, he placed an apple laced with toxic chemicals on the desk of his physics tutor. The tutor, Patrick Blackett, was an experimentalist and he had hounded Robert to do more of what he thought Robert wasn't very good at, experimental work. Oppenheimer had already been spending his days in a corner of JJ Thompson's basement laboratory, attempting to make thin films of beryllium, which were used to study electrons. But Oppenheimer was clumsy and not good at this work. He was soon avoiding his duties in the lab, spending his time listening to lectures and reading physics journals. It was 1925 and the 21 year old Oppenheimer was becoming fascinated by the new field of quantum mechanics. Despite being surrounded by brilliant physicists like Rutherford and Chadwick, Oppenheimer was deeply unhappy. He wrote, 'I'm having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I'm so bad at it that it's impossible to feel that I'm learning anything.' A friend walked in on him, lying on the floor of his room, which he called 'A miserable hole', groaning and rolling from side to side in emotional anguish. It was in this state that Robert attempted to poison Blackett. The specifics are lost to history. There are conflicting reports if Oppenheimer used cyanide or something he found in the lab, which would've just made Blackett sick. This story sounds unbelievable, but Oppenheimer himself confirmed it. Luckily, Blackett did not eat the apple, but the attempted poisoning became known to the Cambridge University authorities. Robert's parents were visiting their son from the US at the time, and Julius Oppenheimer successfully lobbied Cambridge not to press criminal charges. Due to his family's wealth, Robert wasn't even expelled from Cambridge on the condition that he had periodic counseling sessions with a psychiatrist in London. (train horn blaring) In the summer of 1926, Robert traveled to the University of Göttingen. The chairman of the department was Max Born, who just two years earlier had coined the term, 'Quantum Mechanics'. Born was reportedly a thoughtful and gentle teacher and had nurtured the work of Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi, and Eugene Wigner, basically the who's who of quantum mechanics. The class that Oppenheimer was in was also extraordinary, including luminaries like Paul Dirac and John Von Neumann, where the academic culture at Cambridge focused on experimental physics. Göttingen was all about theoretical physics, and under Max Born's mentorship, Oppenheimer thrived. His mental health improved, and he found a community of people who were as obsessed with physics as he was. On November 14th, 1926, Robert wrote to Frank, his younger brother, 'You would like Göttingen. I find the work hard, thank God, and almost pleasant.' Robert was thriving and his talent was being recognized. Born later wrote, 'He was a man of great talent and he was conscious of his superiority in a way which was embarrassing and led to trouble.' When Oppenheimer was 23, he graduated with his PhD in physics. He wrote his thesis in German on the quantum theory of continuous spectra. All in all, he published more than a dozen papers in the two years he was at Göttingen. Many of them expanded upon the work of Werner Heisenberg, who was just three years older than Oppenheimer. The two eventually met in 1927, the same year Heisenberg published his groundbreaking paper on the Quantum uncertainty principle. By all accounts, the pair got along well. There was no way to know that just 15 years later, they would be deadly rivals attempting to build the first nuclear bomb. Oppenheimer for the USA and Heisenberg for Nazi Germany. At the time, it was thought that getting significant amounts of energy out of radioactive atoms was impossible. Ever since the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie in the late 1890s, it was known that radioactivity was a passive process. Unstable atoms would just decay at random, unpredictable times, and surely there was no way to control that. In 1933, Ernest Rutherford, Oppenheimer's old boss from Cambridge wrote that, 'Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformations of these atoms is talking moonshine.' That same year, Albert Einstein said, 'That there is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.' So how would you break an atomic nucleus? Well, you could take a proton and accelerate it through a large electric field and then smash it into a nucleus. This is exactly what John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton did in 1932. They accelerated protons into lithium nuclei, breaking them apart. The pair would later win a Nobel Prize for this work, but a proton is positively charged, so it's repelled by all nuclei, which are also positively charged. So to give them a hope of overcoming this barrier, Cockcroft and Walton had to use 250,000 volts to accelerate the protons. Even then, only about one in a billion protons actually hit and split a lithium nucleus, so this would not be an effective way to get energy. But there is another way. In 1932, the neutron was discovered this subatomic particle that's about 0.1% heavier than a proton, and it has no electric charge, so a neutron would not be repelled from a nucleus. And in 1933, Leo Szilard was thinking about how you could use neutrons to split nuclei. 'It suddenly occurred to me that if we could find an element which is split by neutrons and which would emit two neutrons when it absorbed one neutron, such an element if assembled sufficiently large mass, could sustain a nuclear chain reaction.' But the thing is, nobody knew if there was an element that had a kind of nucleus that would do that. On the 29th of January, 1939, Louise Alvarez, a promising young physicist, was getting a haircut while reading 'The San Francisco Chronicle', and suddenly he got outta the chair halfway through the haircut and ran to Oppenheimer's office. Alvarez read an article about how two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann had successfully split an atom of uranium by bombarding it with neutrons. Oppenheimer was not impressed. 'That's impossible.' He reportedly told the Young Alvarez proceeding to mathematically prove on his blackboard why fission could never be achieved. But the next day, Alvarez had repeated the experiment and invited Oppenheimer to see it. Alvarez later recalled that, 'In less than 15 minutes, he not only agreed that the reaction was authentic, but also speculated that in the process, extra neutrons would boil off. That could be used to split more uranium atoms and thereby generate power or make bombs.' When a single atom of uranium-235 splits apart, it loses a little bit of mass, which is released as energy. Following Einstein's mass energy equivalence. That is a tiny amount of energy, about 20 times less than the amount required to raise a grain of sand, the thickness of a piece of paper. But atoms are also tiny. In a one kilogram lump of uranium, there are about a trillion, trillion atoms, so the energy quickly adds up. Soon, almost everyone was convinced in August of 1939, Einstein, who just six years earlier believed that nuclear bombs were impossible, signed his name to a letter addressed to President Franklin Roosevelt. The letter actually written by Szilard warned Roosevelt of the possibility of nuclear weapons. It also pointed out that Germany had access to uranium from the mines in Czechoslovakia, which was recently taken over by the Nazis. Roosevelt began an informal uranium committee to discuss this topic, but then for two years, nothing happened. In 1941, Roosevelt upgraded the informal uranium committee to the S-1 committee, which would report directly to the White House. The explicit goal was to develop an atomic bomb, and in May, 1942, Oppenheimer was hired onto the committee to be the coordinator of rapid rupture. So why was he selected? (dramatic music) Well, after completing his PhD, Oppenheimer became a physics professor, first at UC Berkeley, and then at Caltech, the brilliance he had shown under Max Born's tutelage didn't fade. Indeed, it blossomed into a remarkable but strange physics career. In the 15 years after finishing his PhD, Oppenheimer made important contributions to everything from nuclear physics to quantum field theory, and even astrophysics. He had a number of Nobel Prize winning ideas. One of his students, Willis Lamb, became a Nobel laureate, but Oppenheimer himself was nominated three times, but never actually won the Nobel Prize. When asked why he thought that Oppenheimer never won the Nobel Prize, Murray Gell-Mann said that, 'He didn't have Sitzfleisch' A German word that translates to sitting flesh. The ability to sit down in a chair for a long time and do the hard work. 'He never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation. He didn't have the patience for that.' Wolfgang Pauli also said, 'His ideas are very good, but his calculations are always wrong.' But Oppenheimer was amazing with people. He was a natural and charismatic leader, and this combination, his charisma and his ability to generate great ideas would serve him well in the next phase of his life. (upbeat music) On the 18th of September, 1942, general Leslie Groves was put in charge of the Manhattan Project. - I was responsible for the development of the atomic bomb. - [Derek] On day one, he ordered 1200 tons of uranium ore. The next day, he ordered to buy the Oak Ridge site where the ore would be refined. The next month in a surprising move, he chose Oppenheimer to be the science director of the soon to be established Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer had just been selected to be the chief architect of the atomic bomb. The military establishment had concerns. Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, so would the scientists hired for the project, respect his opinion, and follow his leadership? Oppenheimer also had no prior administrative experience over a large project like this. Furthermore, he was a theoretical physicist, who according to Isidor Rabi, 'Was a very impractical fellow. He didn't know anything about equipment.' And then there was the problem of Oppenheimer's political stance. He had links to the Communist Party, including his wife, Catherine, who was a member of that party. But Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer. He valued his overwhelming ambition. He also knew that Oppenheimer's ability to understand problems not just in physics, but chemistry, engineering, and metallurgy would be invaluable. Groves thought that Oppenheimer was a 'Real genius.' Saying that why Oppenheimer knows about everything. 'He can talk to you about anything you bring up. Well, not exactly. He doesn't know anything about sports.' The two men couldn't have been more different. Oppenheimer weighed half as much as Groves despite both of them being nearly six feet tall. Ideologically, Oppenheimer was a communist. Groves, a staunch conservative, but Groves was convinced that Oppenheimer would be the person that would build the atomic bomb before the Nazis, and that was all that mattered. Isador Rabi later commented that, hiring Oppenheimer for this role was 'A real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius.' The Manhattan Project needed a location. Somewhere isolated to keep the project secret safe from enemy attack. And while no one wanted to admit it, somewhere that was sparsely populated, just in case there was an accident, Oppenheimer proposed Los Alamos, New Mexico. He had fallen in love with the harsh desert in the mountains of New Mexico when he was in his twenties. In 1929, Oppenheimer wrote to a friend. 'My two great loves are physics and New Mexico. It's a pity they can't be combined.' But Oppenheimer had severely underestimated the logistical challenge ahead. (gentle music) In 1943, Oppenheimer estimated that he'd need about six scientists supported by a handful of engineers and technicians to make a bomb. He was off by two orders of magnitude. 764 scientists would end up working for the Manhattan Project. 302 of which would work at the Los Alamos site. Over 600,000 people in total were involved with the making of the atomic bomb. By this point, making the atom bomb didn't seem impossible. It seemed likely. On the 2nd of December, 1942, a team of physicists at the University of Chicago led by Enrico Fermi created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor Pile-1. It consisted of 45 tons of uranium and uranium oxide and 330 tons of graphite blocks. Horrifyingly enough. It was located under the stands of the football field. It generated about half a watt of power, and if you can make a nuclear power plant, you can make a bomb. The only real difference between the two is how many neutrons hit the next atom, causing it to split and release more neutrons. If on average that number is one, there will be a stable self-sustaining chain reaction, but it won't grow. If it's less than one, the reaction will die down, and if it's more than one, the reaction will grow. This is known as the multiplication factor, K. Nuclear reactions are similar to pandemics in this way. The simplest way to make a nuclear bomb is to get enough fissile material close together that it creates a runaway chain reaction. That amount is known as the critical mass. With uranium-235, you need about 52 kilograms. Forming a sphere with a diameter of 17 centimeters. If you use plutonium-239, the critical mass is much smaller, only around 10 kilograms, which would create a sphere only 10 centimeters wide. For the first few years, the scientists worked on a bomb with a gun type design. Inside a gun type bomb, you have two slabs of uranium-235, both of which are below the critical mass. Then using a conventional explosive like cordite, you rapidly fire one towards the other. So the combined mass is","J. Robert Oppenheimer, a pivotal physicist, played a central role in developing the atomic bomb, significantly shaping modern history. Despite his lack of a Nobel Prize, Oppenheimer's leadership brought together top scientists to create a weapon that forever altered warfare and peace. His early life was marked by personal struggles, including a failed attempt to poison a tutor, but his brilliance blossomed under Max Born in Göttingen, Germany. Eventually, he was chosen to lead the Manhattan Project, where his scientific expertise and charisma helped coordinate the development of the bomb, culminating in its success during World War II."
"- This video is about one of the most important questions: what leads to a happy life? - Realistically, money. - Being wealthy is definitely a big aspect of it. - To save a lot of money. - Money. - Money. - Earning money. - It's very important to be rich. - It's easy for people to say they don't care about having money and that money can't buy happiness, but that's really not true. - 'Cause I would rather cry on a yacht than in a like a Subaru. (both laugh) - [Derek] Clearly, having a successful career and financial wealth are important to people. Is there a number in mind? Something you wanna get to? - At least a million. - Yeah? - Yeah. - In a survey from 2018 of around a hundred thousand college freshmen, about 55% said they wanted to be successful in their career and 83% reported that they wanted to become rich. But do these accomplishments really increase happiness? Well, that's what I wanna find out in this video. But how do you study what makes people happy? Well, you can ask them. What's gonna make you happy? - Um. - Uh. - Uh. - Uh. - Ooh. - [Derek] But people aren't really good at judging what will make them happy. Winning the lottery seems like it should make you happy. - What!? (sister screams) What!? What!? - [Derek] But numerous studies on lottery winners find that after the initial surge of happiness wears off, many are no happier than the rest of us. Some are, in fact, more miserable than they were beforehand. - 'Cause you don't see as many people as you used to see. Obviously, you become slightly isolated, I think in some ways. - Yeah, I agree. - Another problem is that people's memories aren't reliable. - We only detect, encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us. It's called reconstructed memories. It happens to us in all the aspects of our lives all the time. - Most studies on happiness find older people and ask them to recall what made them happy. But as we've just seen, memory is unreliable. So a better way to conduct a study would be to follow people throughout their entire lives, capturing the choices they make and how those affect their happiness. That is really hard to do. But there is one study like this that's been running since 1938. Now, 85 years is a long time to run a study so it has been passed down from one generation of researchers to the next. It's currently run by its fourth director, Robert Waldinger. What is the claim to fame then of the study? - You know, the claim to fame is that it is, as far as we know, the longest study of human development that's ever been done. The longest study of any depth. These are studies that take deep dives into people's lives and their mental and physical health. - [Derek] The study actually began as two separate studies by two groups of Harvard researchers that didn't know about each other. The first group followed 268 young men from Harvard to find out how they would develop into early adulthood. - So of course, if you wanna study normal young adult development, you study all white guys from Harvard, right? (Derek laughs) You know, it's one of those limitations. - [Derek] The second group studied 456 boys from middle school onwards from Boston's poorest and most disadvantaged families. - So there were these two studies, both meant to be studies of what goes right in development and how we predict who does well as they grow up. - Eventually, the two studies merged into one: The Harvard Study of Adult Development. At the start of the study, the participants were interviewed and received extensive physical examinations. And as they grew, they entered all walks of life. Some of them became bricklayers and doctors and factory workers and lawyers, and one even became president of the United States. (presidential music) Every two years, researchers ask them questions about their lives. Like, 'If you could stop working without loss of income, would you, what would you do instead? How often do you feel isolated from others? True or false, life has more pain than pleasure.' And other questions about their marriage, career, friendships, and their physical and mental health. While the study started with just 724 participants, over time, their spouses and children were also included in the study. So how many people are we talking about in total who have been part of the study? - Between 2,500 and 3,000 people altogether in the study. - [Derek] And as technology improved, so did the methods of data collection. - We now draw blood from DNA. You know, DNA wasn't even imagined in 1938. We measure messenger RNA, DNA methylation, we bring people into our laboratory, we deliberately stress them out and then see how quickly they recover from stress. Looking at heart rate variability, for example, looking at cortisol deposited in hair, because that seems to be a long-term measure of circulating cortisol. But all of these new methods are in the service of studying the same big phenomena of human wellbeing. - So what do 85 years of research across entire human lives teach us about a healthy and happy life? - Two huge takeaways really. One is no surprise. It's that if you take care of your physical health, it has huge benefits, not just for your longevity, but for how long you stay healthy. Eating well, getting regular exercise, not abusing alcohol or drugs, not smoking, getting preventive healthcare, exercise is hugely important. - [Derek] A Taiwanese study looked at the medical data of 416,000 healthy people between 1996 and 2008. Eight years later, they followed up with each person to look at the link between exercise and mortality. They found that people who exercised just 15 minutes a day had a 14% reduced risk of dying, and a three year longer life expectancy. Every additional 15 minutes of exercise decreased the risk of dying by an extra 4%. A large meta-analysis from 2008 confirms that people who are physically active have a reduced risk of dying during the timeframes investigated in each study. Exercise also protects our cognitive health. A meta-analysis from 2014 found that participants with higher levels of physical activity had a 35% reduced risk of cognitive decline and a 14% reduced risk of dementia. - And then the big surprising finding is, relationships, not just keeping us happier, but keeping us healthier and helping us live longer. - It's not just the Harvard study. There's now a whole list of studies that show the importance of relationships to human happiness and health. They teach us three main lessons. The first is that relationships are great for our health. In 2010, researchers looked across 148 studies with a total of more than 300,000 participants. They found that, on average, people with stronger social connections had a 50% increased likelihood of survival for any given year. Being married, in particular, has a large impact on how long people live. - There's one study, I think it's pretty well respected, that suggests that married men live 12 years longer on average than unmarried men and married women live seven years longer on average than unmarried women. Marriage is always a better deal for men on all parameters than it is for women. (Derek laughs) And it's not because you have a marriage license, right? It's because people living together in an intimate partnership tend to keep each other healthier. You have somebody who's kind of watching, looking out for you. It's a very real, concrete effect. - If feeling well-connected to others makes us happier, healthier, and extends our lives, then what happens if we feel disconnected? - There's a researcher, Julianne Holt-Lunstad, out of the University of Utah, who did a meta-analysis of a whole slew of studies of the physical effects of loneliness. And her calculation was that being lonely is as dangerous to your health as smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day, or as dangerous as being obese. - [Derek] Feeling disconnected from others also makes you more prone to disease. A large meta-analysis from 2016 found that poor social relationships were associated with a 29% increase in risk of heart disease and a 32% increase in risk of stroke. - So these have real sort of quantifiable consequences when we look at studies of thousands of people. - One caveat is that most studies on the health effects of loneliness focus on people aged 50 and older. (clock ticking) And loneliness is on the rise. - The U.S. Surgeon General today declared a new public health epidemic in America. Loneliness. - We're now finding that one in two adults report measurable levels of loneliness and it turns out that young people are most affected. And here's why this is so concerning. It's because we've realized that loneliness is more than just a bad feeling. It has real consequences for our mental and physical health. - The UK has appointed a minister of loneliness. Many, many countries are concerned about this breakdown in social connection. - A question about loneliness, like, what does that look like? Because, obviously, everyone experiences some periods of loneliness. So you know, when does it become sort of really detrimental and how do we define that? - Well, loneliness is different from being alone, right? So you can be alone and quite content, and many people are, in fact. The ability to be content when you're alone is quite a skill and it's a wonderful ability. Loneliness is that subjective experience of being less connected to people than you wanna be. And that's why, you know, you can be lonely in a crowd. We're all on a spectrum between extroversion, you know, wanting lots of people in our lives, and introversion, actually needing a lot of solitude and not wanting a lot of people, a lot of people are stressful for introverts. And what we know is that neither one is healthier, right? Like introverts are perfectly healthy. They just may need one or two really solid relationships and don't want a lot more people. Nothing wrong with that at all. Whereas extroverts may want lots of people in their lives. - [Derek] So the second lesson is that it's not how many people you know or see, or even whether you're married or not, because a bad marriage can be worse for your health than getting divorced. Instead, it's about the quality of your close relationships that matters. - When we'd followed all the original people out to their 80s we said, 'Okay, what data actually are the best predictors at age 50 of who's gonna be happy and healthy at age 80 as opposed to sick or dead?' And we thought we were gonna be looking at blood pressure and cholesterol level at age 50 as the strongest predictors. It was their relationships. It was particularly their satisfaction with their marital relationships that was the strongest predictor. - And relationships don't just keep us happier and physically healthier, they also protect our brains. People who are in secure relationships in their 80s, where they feel that they can rely on the other person, find that their memories stay sharper for longer. And people who feel lonely, well, their memories fade quicker. A study of retired U.S. adults found that the rate of cognitive decline was 20% higher over 10 years for those who felt lonely. A meta-analysis from 2018 further confirms the detrimental effects of loneliness, finding that it also increased the risk of dementia. But there's still a big open question: what is it about the relationships that makes them particularly healthful or helpful? - The best hypothesis, for which there's some pretty decent research now, is that relationships are emotion regulators. They're stress regulators. So stressful things happen every day to many of us, right? So then what happens? Well, the body goes into fight-or-flight mode, blood pressure goes up, respirations become more rapid, circulating stress hormone levels rise. But then the body is meant to go back to equilibrium after that normal fight-or-flight response when we face a challenge. If I can come home and there's somebody here to talk to, I can literally feel my body calm down. What we are pretty sure happens is that people who are isolated, that they're more likely to stay in a kind of chronic fight-or-flight mode. And that what that means is that they have higher levels of circulating cortisol, higher levels of chronic inflammation, and that those things gradually wear away body systems. So that's how, for example, chronic stress can predict coronary artery disease, but also arthritis and also type-two diabetes because of this common mechanism that breaks down multiple body systems. - The key to preventing this breakdown is simple. Just spend a little more time with the people you care about. Unfortunately, we seem to be doing the exact opposite. Before going into why we're doing the exact opposite, this part of the video was sponsored by BetterHelp. There are many things that can negatively impact our happiness. It could be stress or fear or a clinical mental health issue like depression or anxiety.

If you feel like you could benefit from talking to someone, getting feedback, advice, and help for anything that might be","The video explores the relationship between wealth, success, and happiness, emphasizing that while money plays a significant role in achieving happiness, it is not the sole factor. Despite common beliefs, studies show that wealth alone doesn't guarantee lasting happiness, as seen in lottery winners who often experience fleeting joy. Long-term studies, such as the 85-year-old Harvard Study of Adult Development, reveal that good physical health, including regular exercise, contributes significantly to longevity and well-being. However, the most surprising finding is the critical role of relationships in both happiness and health, with strong social connections linked to longer life expectancy and better cognitive health. Loneliness, in contrast, is shown to have harmful effects, comparable to smoking or obesity. Quality relationships, particularly in marriage, are the most important predictors of happiness and health in later life, underscoring the emotional support these connections provide in regulating stress and maintaining overall well-being."
"- Ever since the invention of nuclear weapons, humanity has almost accidentally destroyed itself many times over. This is a video about just some of those times. (rocket whooshing) It's about nuclear bombs and missiles accidentally detonating. It's about hydrogen bombs being lost. And it's about false alarms that could have led to the end of the world. (bomb rumbling) On the 17th of January, 1966, a B-52 bomber was flying over the coast of Spain. It was carrying four hydrogen bombs, each one 75 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This sounds crazy, but in the mid 1960s, during the height of the Cold War, this was routine. This was part of a military operation known as Chrome Dome where bombers flew around the United States and skirted the borders of the Soviet Union with hydrogen bombs on board. The thinking was that if the USSR initiated a first strike, the US could rapidly retaliate by having bombers already up in the air and closer to their targets. The flight took off from North Carolina and crossed the Atlantic Ocean with the plan to fly by the border of the Soviet Union and return home. The plane would be in the air for more than 24 hours. The flight was so long, it required two mid-air refuelings. But long flights and mid-air refuelings were commonplace. Flights like this happened every day. The first refuelling went smoothly. After flying by the Soviet Union and turning around, the plane needed to be refuelled again. So at 10:30 a.m., over the coast of Spain, above the small fishing village of Palomares, the refuelling tanker pulled up in front of the B-52. Larry Messinger, the pilot of the bomber, recalled. - [Larry] We came up behind the tanker and we were going a little bit too fast. There's a procedure they have where the boom operator, if you get in a dangerous position, he calls, 'Break away, break away, break away,' and you immediately cut the throttles and drop down below. Well, there was no such call. We were dropping down below the tanker and all of a sudden something happened. There was an explosion of some kind. - The two planes collided. The boom arm, which held the refuelling nozzle, hit the B-52, breaking off its left wing. The resulting explosion was big enough that it was witnessed by another B-52 which was flying a kilometre and a half away. All four men on the refuelling tanker and three of the seven on the B-52 were killed in the accident. The four bombs fell to earth. Each one of them had a yield of 1.1 megatons of TNT, about 75 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. A hydrogen bomb gets most of its power from the fusion of tritium and deuterium, which are isotopes of hydrogen with extra neutrons. When these isotopes fuse into helium, a little bit of mass is lost, which is released as energy. But it takes a tremendous amount of energy to get that reaction started, which is why a hydrogen bomb is actually three bombs in one. A conventional bomb which when detonated triggers the plutonium fission bomb which then creates high enough temperatures and pressures and releases enough energetic X-rays to trigger the fusion reaction. The conventional explosives in two of the four bombs detonated on impact. Fortunately, to trigger the fission reaction, the explosion needs to be symmetrical. But since the conventional explosives detonated on impact with the ground, the shockwave wasn't symmetrical and so the fission and fusion bombs weren't set off. Unfortunately, the conventional explosive blew up the plutonium core, contaminating a 2.6-square-kilometer area of the Spanish coastline with radioactive material. The area is still contaminated with radioactive atoms to this day. - [Reporter] But after the crash the villagers were told to eat no locally produced food and there was an embargo on it in nearby markets. - The third bomb was found intact in a nearby riverbed. But the fourth bomb was missing. - [Reporter] Somewhere out there off the sunny coast of southern Spain and H bomb is missing. It's been missing now for over three weeks. - Mr. Ambassador, how was your swim this morning? Did you by any chance stub your toe on the bomb while you were out there today? - Wish I had. - 29 US Army ships were involved in the search, and it still took 81 days for the bomb to finally be located and recovered. I wanna say this again. There was a hydrogen bomb that was 75 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima, and it was missing for nearly three months. This is not an isolated incident. It's common enough that the US military has a term for accidents involving nuclear weapons. - [Reporter] The D-Day clock thus begun ticking with a potential Broken Arrow message from Nellis Air Force Base. - They call them Broken Arrows. The Pentagon officially lists 32 such accidents between 1950 and 1980. Five of them occurred during operation Chrome Dome, cases when a B-52 carrying hydrogen bombs crashed. In 1961, the first year of operation Chrome Dome, a B-52 had a fuel leak and it crashed over North Carolina. Three members of the crew died in the accident. It was carrying two 4-megaton bombs. Both bombs fell to earth. One had its parachute deploy and it landed on the ground mostly intact. The other slammed into a field and broke into pieces. The good news is that the conventional explosives did not explode, so radioactive plutonium was not strewn all over North Carolina. The bad news is that the conventional explosives didn't explode, and so there was a chance that the hydrogen bombs could be armed and ready to detonate with full force. Recalling the incident 52 years later, Lieutenant Jack ReVelle, who was responsible for the safe disposal of the bomb, said. - [Jack] And as we started digging down, trying to find the second bomb, one of my sergeants says, 'Hey, Lieutenant, I found the arm safe switch.' And I said, 'Great.' He says, 'No, not great. It's on arm.' - At the time, a spokesman for the Department of Defence said that the bombs were unarmed and could not have accidentally exploded. But in a report declassified in 2013, it was stated that the bomb was armed. A single switch could have triggered the detonation. By the way, the bomb is still there, lodged about 50 metres under the field. After the bomb fell on the field, there was a flash flood, which meant that it couldn't be recovered. So to make sure that no one could dig up the bomb, the US military placed a 120-meter diameter slab of concrete over the whole area. According to the Pentagon report, there is no detectable radiation and no hazard in the area, but a portion of one weapon containing uranium is missing. There are dozens more events like this, like the plane crash over Greenland in 1968. The four hydrogen bombs it was carrying burned up in the fire. The decontamination of the surrounding area took four months. That same year, the Soviet K-129 submarine sank in the Pacific Ocean, killing all 98 of its crew. It was also carrying three nuclear warheads. Part of the submarine was covertly recovered by the CIA. Another standout incident occurred in 1965, about 100 kilometres off the coast of Japan. A Douglas A-4 jet carrying at least one hydrogen bomb fell off the aircraft carrier during a training exercise. The plane, the bomb, and the pilot were never recovered. So, for more than half a century, there has been a 1-megaton hydrogen bomb laying on the sea floor four kilometres below the surface of the ocean. It is one of at least six US nuclear weapons that have been lost and never recovered. In 1998, Alexander Lebed, Russia's former Chief of National Security, asserted that there are more than 100 1-kiloton nuclear bombs that are unaccounted for. The most well-known Broken Arrow event happened in September 1980. Inside a silo in rural Arkansas, a team was conducting routine checks on the Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile was fueled, ready to launch at a moment's notice. In its nose cone sat a 9-megaton hydrogen bomb. As one of the repairmen was walking around the silo, the socket from his ratchet wrench fell off. (ominous music) It fell 24 metres, hitting the fuel tank of the missile and puncturing a hole. The highly flammable rocket fuel began to leak into the silo. The missile complex and surrounding area were evacuated, but a number of military personnel remained on site to try to diffuse the situation. - The maintenance team had an indication of an engine fire and a rise in vapour concentration inside the silo. - At 3:00 a.m., about 8 1/2 hours after the puncture of the fuel tank, the leaking fuel vapours ignited, resulting in an explosion. This explosion led to one death and 21 injuries. The 740-ton door keeping the silo sealed flew more than 60 metres into the air. It was recovered 200 metres away. The warhead containing the hydrogen bomb was also blown out of the silo, landing some 30 metres away. Luckily, it did not detonate. And these are just the near misses that we know about. Of the 32 Broken Arrow events listed by the Pentagon, one which occurred in the spring of 1968 remains classified. And there are likely many dozens more nuclear mistakes and near misses the public knows nothing about from every nation that has a nuclear arsenal. The worry of a nuclear mishap is not just the immediate damage done by a hydrogen bomb explosion. It's also the misunderstanding and retaliatory strikes that could arise. Imagine that in 1966, instead of hydrogen bombs falling off the coast of Spain, the plane crash occurred closer to the border with the Soviet Union. Humanity has been on the brink of nuclear war many times and so far we've been lucky. The closest we've likely ever come was in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The US Navy began dropping signalling charges into the water to bring a Soviet submarine to the surface. Tensions were high and the submarine had not been in radio contact with Moscow for days. The captain of the submarine decided that war had broken out and he was about to launch a nuclear torpedo. But the launch required the authorization of three men. Two out of the three authorised the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov did not. A full-blown nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union was avoided by the rational decision of one person. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. later noted that 'this was not only the most dangerous moment of the Cold War. It was the most dangerous moment in human history.' And during the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the tensions between the US and USSR at an all-time high, both countries still conducted high-altitude nuclear tests. The US set off a 410-kiloton bomb 50 kilometres above the Pacific Ocean and a smaller 7-kiloton bomb at an altitude of 147 kilometres. Two of the 300 kiloton tests conducted by the Soviets occurred in space. It's pretty hard to justify these actions. What if one of these tests was thought to be a nuclear first strike leading to all-out war? Because false alarms happen for something a lot more innocuous than nuclear tests in space. On the 26th of September, 1983, the Soviet satellite-based early warning system detected the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, and their policy dictated that if any inbound missiles were detected, there was to be an immediate counter attack against the United States. This would've likely led to all-out war. But the Soviet officer on duty at the time of the detection, Stanislav Petrov, was sceptical of the reading. He reasoned that if there was a genuine first strike, the US would launch hundreds of ICBMs simultaneously, not just one. The detection system then warned Petrov of another four missiles headed towards the USSR, but these two, he dismissed as a glitch. Petrov was right. He made the right decision and his clear thinking likely saved millions of lives. The warning system malfunctioned, it confused sunlight reflecting off high-altitude clouds for ballistic missiles. After this incident, Petrov took an early retirement and later suffered a nervous breakdown. Another close call happened on January 25th, 1995, when scientists launched a rocket off the coast of Norway. Their rocket was there to study the Northern Lights but Russian radar picked up this launch as it had a similar flight pattern and speed as the submarine-launched Trident ICBM. The incident was serious enough that a briefcase containing the nuclear launch codes was taken to the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin. I think most people believe the biggest threat posed by nuclear weapons is their deliberate use. There is this idea that as long as nations only have them and don't use them, they could act as a deterrent keeping us safer. But all of these incidents demonstrate that the real risk of nuclear weapons is some freak accident. So far, humanity has been lucky, but how long until our luck runs out? But there is hope. In 1986, there were more than 70,000 nuclear weapons. In 2022, that number had dropped to 12,705, and more are being dismantled. But as long as there are any nuclear weapons remaining, the future of humanity is not safe. (electronic beeping) Hey, this part of the video is brought to you by Henson Shaving. Close shaves are bad when it comes to nuclear weapons but they're great when it comes to shaving. Henson is a company that was started by aerospace machinists who wanted to use their experience in precision manufacturing to create a better shaving experience. And honestly, I think they've succeeded. I've been using their AL13 for the past few months and it's the best shave I've ever had. The razor is made using CNC machines with incredibly tight tolerances, so the blade sticks out just .03 millimetres. This means that the blade is perfectly supported which reduces chatter, the up and down movement of the blade. This reduction in chatter reduces skin irritation. In fact, Henson conducted a test where participants shaved the left part of their face with a multi-blade razor and the right part with the AL13, and they saw a statistically significant reduction in skin irritation when the Henson razor was used. The AL13 is really high quality and it uses standard double-edged blades which are much less expensive than the proprietary blades sold by other companies. So, once you own a Henson razor, the cost of shaving works out to be just 3 to $5 per year, depending on how often you shave. And because you're not","Since the invention of nuclear weapons, humanity has faced numerous accidental near-misses involving detonations, lost bombs, and false alarms that could have led to global disaster. Notable incidents include a 1966 B-52 crash over Spain, resulting in the loss of hydrogen bombs, a 1961 crash in North Carolina, and several near-detonations during mishaps involving bombs on planes and missiles. False alarms, like the 1983 Soviet missile detection error and the 1995 Russian misinterpretation of a Norwegian rocket launch, also brought the world to the brink of war. Despite over 30 such 'Broken Arrow' events, nuclear weapons accidents have been narrowly avoided, though the ongoing existence of nuclear arsenals remains a significant global threat."
"As Europe flourished during the Enlightenment, advancing in literacy, math, and science, so, too, did Leonhard Euler’s brilliance. He published over 800 works in his lifetime, and more than half of them were completed after he had gone blind. Leonhard Euler was born on April 15, 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to pastor Paul and his wife Margaretha. He spent his early years in the nearby village of Riehen. Growing up in the quiet countryside is said to have shaped Euler's calm and steady temperament, enabling him to maintain extraordinary focus and resilience, even after losing his sight. At the age of seven, he was already studying an advanced algebra textbook far beyond the typical understanding of most children - or even adults - at that time. At 13, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel, which, like many European universities, admitted students much younger than is typical today. While the university itself was not particularly prestigious, Euler had the good fortune of being tutored by a brilliant mathematician. Johann Bernoulli was the leading mathematician of the era. By then, Isaac Newton was in his final years, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had already passed away. Although Bernoulli declined to provide private lessons due to his busy schedule, he invited Euler to visit every Saturday afternoon to discuss any challenges he encountered, and Euler was grateful: “...when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences.” After receiving his bachelor's and master’s, he began studying theology, as his father wanted him to become a pastor but Leonhard’s heart lay in mathematics. Bernoulli is said to have visited Paul Euler, his former college classmate, to convince him that his son was a prodigy destined to be his successor. Paul agreed to let his son dedicate himself fully to mathematics, yet Leonhard never abandoned his Christian faith. Euler viewed the harmony in mathematics as evidence of a divine creator. His famous equation, Euler’s Identity, unites five fundamental constants, blending a mix of real and imaginary numbers in a simple yet profound way that results in zero. Establishing a career in math in early 18th-century Switzerland was difficult as opportunities were scarce in the small country. He applied to become a physics professor at the University of Basel, but at 19, he was deemed too young to make the final cut. In hindsight, being rejected was a blessing. To reach his full potential, Euler needed the collaborative environment of a larger institution. As Ronald S. Calinger, author of a comprehensive biography on Euler, explains: “The social, institutional, and intellectual setting throws light on the intensity of collaboration and debate, and it is a principal factor in determining what questions and problems will be central.” There was one place where such a setting existed - Russia, then part of a vast and powerful empire. When a position opened up in St. Petersburg at the Academy of Sciences, Euler’s good friend Daniel Bernoulli, the son of Johann Bernoulli and a member of the academy, recommended him. On April 5, 1727, he boarded a boat in Basel, traveling along the Rhine River, before arriving in St. Petersburg in May. Although Euler was offered an adjunct position in the Department of Physiology, he redirected his energy toward math, collaborating with brilliant mathematicians like Jakob Hermann and his friend Daniel Bernoulli, and corresponding often with Christian Goldbach who was in Moscow. He tackled many fascinating challenges in St. Petersburg. One of the most famous was the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The Prussian city of Königsberg, now modern-day Kaliningrad, Russia, was divided by a river with seven bridges connecting four regions. Residents often wondered whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and return to their starting point. Euler approached the problem by simplifying the layout. He represented each area as a dot, or node, and each bridge as a line, or edge, connecting the nodes. The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the number of bridges or edges connected to each area, referred to as the degree of a node. For example, Node A has five connection points, while Node B has three. Node C and Node D each have three connection points as well. For someone to cross each bridge only once and return to their starting point, they must leave each area - or node - via a different bridge than the one they arrived on. So every node must have an even degree - that is, an even number of bridges connected to it - except for the beginning and end of the journey. When Euler analyzed his graph of Königsberg, he found that all four nodes had an odd degree, meaning each area was connected to an odd number of bridges. He therefore concluded that it was impossible to find a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. This was groundbreaking because it showed that the physical layout of the city was irrelevant - the solution depended solely on the connections between nodes, a fundamental concept in graph theory. A big opportunity to advance his career came in 1733 when Daniel Bernoulli decided to leave St. Petersburg, hating the harsh Russian winters and haunted by the death of his brother Nikolaus just eight months after arriving. Euler succeeded Bernoulli as the senior chair of mathematics at the Academy. The promotion came with a substantial pay raise, which put him in a position to court Katharina Gsell, the daughter of a Swiss-born artist working in St. Petersburg. They married in January 1734, and their first child, Johann, was born that November. They went on to have 13 children altogether, though only five survived infancy. Euler is said to have made some of his greatest mathematical discoveries with “a child on his knee and a cat on his shoulder...” One of these was a problem that had stumped mathematicians for nearly a century. The Basel Problem deals with summing the infinite series of reciprocals of integers squared. In other words, if you keep adding up smaller and smaller fractions forever, what number do you get? He worked on the problem on and off for years and solved it in 1735. His solution revealed a surprising link between an abstract problem in number theory and the geometric constant π (pi), traditionally associated with circles and geometry. Uncovering connections between seemingly unrelated areas of math was a testament to his brilliance. While solidifying his reputation as a genius, Euler suffered from severe fevers in his thirties that caused his right eye to go blind. His grandson-in-law, mathematician Nikolas Fuss blamed his blindness on eyestrain from an intense three days of work in 1735. However, historian Ronald Calinger suggests it began with a sudden health crisis in 1738. As Calinger explains, “...great stress leads to a high fever, which together with an infection, produces an eye abscess that contributes to the evolution of blindness…” Regardless of its origin, Euler was not inclined to slow down. As Fuss noted, “He would give up his food before work...” In the midst of his health problems, the Prussian King Frederick the Great recruited him to transform the Berlin Academy into a leading scientific institution. Euler only became interested after the death of the Russian empress Anna in 1740 triggered a power struggle and increased hostility toward foreigners like himself. After 14 years in Saint Petersburg, he packed his bags and arrived in Berlin on July 25, 1741. There, he made groundbreaking contributions to celestial mechanics, particularly in tackling the challenging three-body problem - which involves predicting the motion of an object influenced by the gravity of two others. He applied this to the moon, which is gravitationally pulled by both the Earth and the Sun. The Moon’s elliptical orbit around Earth not only shifts in orientation, but the line of nodes, where the Moon’s orbit crosses Earth’s orbital plane, rotates a full cycle every 18.61 years. Euler’s refined calculations greatly improved the accuracy of these predictions, crucial for astronomy and navigation. The following year, in 1748, Euler published one of the most groundbreaking works in mathematics: Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite. In it, he defined a function as a rule that assigns one output to each input, such as y = x squared, where the rule squares x and gives the result y. This broad concept of a function applying to all values of x laid the foundation for modern algebra, calculus, and graphing. One of the most important functions Euler explored is the exponential function, where e is a special constant approximately equal to 2.718. Exponential functions model real-world phenomena, such as population growth and compound interest. Euler expanded on the idea of exponential growth to uncover something profound. His formula shows that when you use imaginary numbers, represented by i, in an exponential function, instead of just growing, the results follow a circular path in the complex plane. Here’s the fascinating part: as the point moves around this circle, the real and imaginary parts of the function form smooth, wave-like patterns. These patterns are none other than the sine and cosine waves - familiar in sound, light, and the signals that power modern technology. It was a stunning revelation, showing that exponential functions and trigonometry, which might seem unrelated, are actually deeply connected. Euler excelled in so many different areas of mathematics. In geometry, Euler discovered that for any polyhedron, meaning a 3-dimensional figure with flat faces, straight edges, and sharp corners, the number of vertices (V) minus the number of edges (E), plus the number of faces (F), always equals 2. Euler had complete freedom to pursue his work as the King, who was preoccupied with the Silesian Wars against Imperial Austria, didn’t interfere with him and the academy. Euler was content during this period: “The king calls me his professor and I think I am the happiest man in the world.” But that happiness would not last. After the war’s end in 1745, Frederick redirected his attention toward domestic matters, including the academy. The King was rather dismissive of Euler, favoring French intellectuals like Voltaire and preferring literature and philosophy over abstract mathematics. One incident in particular revealed his disdain for math. In 1749, the King asked Euler to design a hydraulic system to power the fountains at his Sanssouci palace in Potsdam so they could soar higher than those at the Palace of Versailles. But the wooden pipes were unable to withstand the high-pressure water, and reinforcing them with metal rims didn’t help. The pipe diameter was also too small to provide enough water flow. Euler lacked practical experience and had not accounted for issues like material limitations or friction. Frustrated by the failure, Frederick reportedly quipped to Voltaire: “Vanity of vanities! Vanity of mathematics.” Euler lacked practical experience and hadn’t accounted for friction and material limitations. But he didn’t let the setback deter him. He would later master the behavior of fluids in his seminal work on fluid dynamics in 1757. His equations of motion reveal how forces like pressure and gravity work together to control the flow of fluids. Imagine water flowing through a slightly tilted pipe. Let’s focus on a small section of the water within the pipe. Two key forces act on this section: the pressure at the lower end pushes the fluid upward, while the opposing pressure at the higher end resists the flow. As the fluid moves upward, the pressure decreases along its length, creating a pressure difference that drives the flow. Additionally, gravity adds another resisting force, pulling the fluid downward. Despite these opposing forces, the water flows upward because the pressure difference at the lower end is strong enough to overcome both the pressure resistance and gravity. Even with all that Euler accomplished, the king still snubbed him. When the academy’s president, French mathematician and philosopher Pierre Louis Maupertuis, passed away, the King refused to consider Euler his successor, preferring the French intellectual Jean le Rond d’Alembert. When d’Alembert declined, unwilling to leave his comfortable life in Paris, the King appointed himself deputy president. When Euler requested the King to secure military positions for his sons, he refused. As author Calinger put it: “He now decided that he and his family should leave; to remain would be disgraceful.” And it just so happened there was one place eager to welcome him. Catherine the Great wanted him to return to St. Petersburg to revitalize the Academy that had fallen into decline. She also agreed to secure positions for Euler’s three sons. When Euler asked to be let go from his contract, Frederick was livid. He ignored Euler’s first two requests and tried to placate him after receiving a third, writing in response, “I would like to let you know that you will please me if you desist from this demand.” Eventually, to avoid a public scandal and so as not to antagonize the Russian Empress, Frederick reluctantly agreed to release Euler, writing: “...I permit you to quit in order to go to Russia.” He didn’t even so much as offer a thank you for his service. Euler arrived in St. Petersburg on July 28, 1766. By then, a cataract in his good left eye had impaired his vision to the point where he couldn't distinguish between a blank page and one with writing. Euler would jokingly say, “Now I will have fewer distractions.” Despite being blind, he produced nearly half of his life's work during this period, authoring over 400 papers, thanks to his incredible memory and ability to perform complex calculations entirely in his head. With the help of an unemployed tailor, Euler dictated his popular text Elements of Algebra, aimed at making mathematics accessible to a wider audience. By the end of their collaboration, the tailor could solve complex algebraic problems himself - a testament to Euler's teaching ability. His blindness made him deeply reliant on those around him not only for dictating his work but also in times of crisis. In May 1771, when a devastating fire swept through St. Petersburg, destroying over 500 homes including his own, his servant, Peter Grimm, scrambled to find a ladder and climb to the second floor to rescue the blind mathematician. Later that year, in September 1771, Euler underwent cataract surgery in the hope of restoring vision to his left eye. While the surgery initially improved his sight, a lack of proper post-surgical care combined with a large incision led to complications, likely an infection, leaving him completely blind once again. Euler was determined not to rely solely on his children for help. When his 66-year-old wife, Katharina, passed away in November 1773, he remarried her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell. Toward the end of his life, Euler suffered from frequent bouts of vertigo as his health declined. On September 18, 1783, he spent his final day much like any other. He taught mathematics to","Leonhard Euler, born in 1707 in Switzerland, was a brilliant mathematician who published over 800 works, many after going blind. He excelled in mathematics from a young age, studying advanced algebra by seven and later working with Johann Bernoulli. Euler made significant contributions in various areas including graph theory, celestial mechanics, and fluid dynamics. He became a professor in St. Petersburg, where he solved the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and made breakthroughs like Euler’s Identity and the Basel Problem. Despite health issues, including blindness, Euler continued to work prolifically, moving to Berlin in 1741 and later returning to St. Petersburg, where he produced half of his work. Euler’s blindness, family struggles, and personal hardships did not hinder his remarkable mathematical legacy, which continues to influence modern mathematics. He passed away in 1783."
"In September 2015, I arrived from the Boston airport on the Dartmouth coach that loops around the green. I felt hopeful about things that were going to happen here, things I'd get to learn and science I'd get to do. But it doesn't feel very much like that anymore. I'm Vassiki Chauhan. I'm a Ph.D. student in the field of cognitive neuroscience. I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at Dartmouth, and I specifically work on how humans perceive faces of other people. When I was in the ninth grade, I got my hands on a book about theory of relativity and Einstein's life and how he became a scientist. And that just blew my mind. I became really intrigued by physics. I spent all my pocket money buying books about cosmology and general relativity and quantum mechanics, like, I was really, really, really into it. Because I was interested in physics, I love thinking about artificial intelligence and robotics. It kind of all came together in the end. When I was pulling into Hanover, and I flew in from Mumbai, I was captivated by these red brick buildings. I felt like I was kind of walking into a dream when I got there. Once I got here, I noticed that in order to fit in, there was a certain amount of, requirement to, go together and get a drink. There were three tenured professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Todd Heatherton, Bill Kelley, and Paul Whalen. They brought in a lot of grants. They were very famous. The professors would be in the bar, and all of a sudden, you know, some women in the group would suddenly have new drinks in their hands that they didn't even choose. They didn't even pay for. And we knew that they were paid for by the professors. That was highly normalized. So, I just went with it. The mentorship was so heavily entangled in this drinking culture. Like if there was a drink in front of you, like to turn it down almost felt like you were turning down advising. Either you go to the bar with him and he'll read your papers, or you don't, and you are neglected. There are now so many red flags and none of them registered to me at all at the time. As a red flag. They would try to keep us from talking to each other about our experiences, and it it worked pretty well. Bill Kelley and Paul Whalen would routinely make jokes about our physical appearance as though this were a competition. I had witnessed Paul Whalen kiss someone on the forehead, and there were just lots of hugs and kind of inappropriate touching. The text messages went from like, “oh, what are you up to? How’s it going? How are you doing?” to, “I've been drinking,” like, “a girl like you would never have a guy like me.” Sending nude photos and telling me, like, what he wanted to do with me. When I entered graduate school with Bill Kelley, I experienced a lot of heavy grooming behaviors from really day one until he physically took advantage of me at a conference. This being my advisor, I was just kind of just like, I didn't push back. I didn't say anything. I felt trapped. Cumulatively, it's like all consistent with how predators behave. One day, Paul Whalen, he invited me to his house for a farewell party to one of his RAs, and there were a bunch of other graduate students there. And then we went to a bar. And after that, I think at that point I was like, okay, if you want to get another beer, this place is closing down. We can go to your house. I'd been to his house before, and I didn't feel like it was anything out of the ordinary. And I was trying to play music, and he had gone to grab beers or something, and I just, I felt his body behind me. And, you know, you don't forget a thing like that. You don't forget that, “Oh, my God. What, what's really happening right now?” I always remember saying “no.” I used the word, I used the action. I was explicit and I know that to the core. He had so much power and influence and weight. And I was just this graduate student from India, like early stages of my Ph.D. It was just this deep and insidious violation of, trust in human behavior. I didn't know for a while the degree of wrongdoing that had happened. I'd heard rumors. I went to a conference, an academic conference, and Todd Heatherton came to a post-conference event at a karaoke bar extremely intoxicated. And he, like, summoned me over to where he was sitting and kind of grabbed me by the butt and sat me on his lap. I just remember feeling this intense sense of embarrassment and shame, and that I would never be taken seriously as a scientist. I started just kind of raging really, in the hotel, in the conference hotel. And then after that, I just started talking to people. To be honest, it took comparing my experience with the other women before I started to realize that I wasn't the problem. We realized how eerie and startling the similarities were between the patterns of these women. We realized these men meant to do this. At first it's just like, oh, this is just my experience. And then it's, oh, other people had these experiences with these three men, and then it's like, oh, a lot of women. We sort of organized ourselves and met with the chairs of the department. Without even naming the professors, they understood. They knew exactly what we were talking about and decided to launch a Title IX investigation. a committee determined that the three professors should be fired. But before that could be finalized, Bill and Paul resigned and Todd retired. If you allow three professors to resign or retire after a yearlong investigation, you're not setting a precedent. You're just doing the easiest, least costly thing for the institution. At that point, it just felt like, okay, maybe what we need to do to effect real change is sue the college from our side, because they need to treat us better. When we first decided to file a lawsuit, I did want to remain anonymous. I felt like I was detonating my career without even really knowing the full extent of the damages. I was worried about not being seen as a scientist, being seen as a victim. But in order to have our stories resonate with other women, in order to get institutions to take interest in what we had to say, we had to go all in. We had to basically put our lives at stake for the impact we wanted to make. The stunning accusations from several young women accusing three male professors at Dartmouth of turning their department into a 21st century animal house. They say, calling it a ‘predators club.’ The response was overwhelmingly positive, and that was very, very encouraging. I've had faculty from other institutions reach out and, ask for more information about our case so that they can make changes within their own department. A lot of Indian women reached out to me, and they're like, given our culture, I can't believe this is something that you decided to do. And it makes me feel like this is an option for me as well. During the lawsuit, I think it was really important for our names and our faces to be part of that because it humanized what that case represented. But it's important to know that our narratives don't end with that case. It's a story that is constantly evolving and unfolding and it is our lives. And we're not defined by that case, but it transforms who we are to this day. So I ended up becoming a research scientist at a startup. I'm really grateful that I've been able to land in a, in a place where I can still do my science, but that has these more, like, checks and balances, and I don't need to worry about that kind of abuse of power being wielded over me. One of the things that I started doing is, actually weight lifting. So I lift heavy weights three or four times a week. I can squat much more than my body weight. It's. Yeah, it's it's really fun. It feels good to, like, be in your own body and, like, feel powerful. I was a graduate student at Dartmouth when the lawsuit came out. I had to finish my Ph.D. in the aftermath of all of that. So some ways, there was a lot of hostility in that moment, in that environment. Given that so much unexpected stuff had happened, I felt like there was no way science would hold on to me. It felt like nobody would want me, in fact. But, I kept following the path of my curiosity. And that brought me to New York City. So now I'm working as a postdoc at Barnard College. Here we are. All right. I can't wait to show this to you. I also work as a publisher now or volunteer as a publisher with Science for the People. This one is the issue that I got involved with. It's about technology. We also have a robust, amazing New York City chapter where we engage in direct action together. It's a really fulfilling experience to not feel alone in wanting science to be more than a profession. I've been very fortunate to maintain a very close tie with my best friend Vassiki. She's fiercely living her life, in, in every aspect, both in her science as a postdoc, her activist work, I'm just always in awe of her. What I've learned is that, if you want to make change, don't go at it alone. Try to do it with people who will share the burden, and, have the same goals as you and as a result and keep you accountable. There very few things I think of as permanent, but our friendship is one of those things.","Vassiki Chauhan, a Ph.D. student in cognitive neuroscience at Dartmouth, experienced a toxic academic culture involving sexual harassment and power abuse by prominent professors. Initially excited by her academic journey, she encountered inappropriate behavior, including grooming, physical violations, and manipulation, primarily by her advisors. As she compared experiences with other women, it became clear that the professors had a pattern of misconduct. After a Title IX investigation and their resignation or retirement, Chauhan and others filed a lawsuit, aiming to create change. Despite initial fears, the lawsuit received positive support and led to broader conversations on harassment in academia. Chauhan continued her career, becoming a postdoc and engaging in activist work, determined to transform science into a more equitable field."
"This video includes a discussion of serious crimes which may be disturbing for some viewers so I wanted to let you know that upfront, but I think it's necessary to talk about these crimes in some detail for reasons that will become apparent. In the small town of Visalia, California in the mid 1970s, one of the state's most prolific criminals got his start. He repeatedly broke into houses and stole small items like cash, coins, and jewelry. He was dubbed the Visalia ransacker but soon his crimes escalated. - Six months later in 1976, he moves up to Sacramento and over the course of the next three years, he's moving all across Northern California committing numerous sexual assaults, over 50 sexual assaults. - Here, he was called the east area rapist. - [Male Reporter] The police are saying lock up tight. Sacramento's infamous east area rapist may still be in town. - And then in 1979, he moves down to Southern California, starting in Santa Barbara and starts killing. And he was known as the original night stalker in Southern California. - [Reporter] Variously known as the east area rapist and the original night stalker, these were brutal meticulously planned crimes that spanned numerous California counties between 1976 and 1986. - Police believed that all of these crimes were committed by the same person now known as the golden state killer. How was it known that these were committed by the same person? - Investigators were relying on MO. MO, modus operandi is basically how a criminal will commit a crime. - He was wearing some type of a mask or a hood. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. - The golden state killer had a very distinctive MO - What he would do is he would break into a house with a gun, a house with a man and a woman. He would tie them up tell the man I'm gonna put plates on your back. If I hear those plates move, I'm going to kill your wife and then kill you, take the wife into another room and sexually assault her. Then he would go through the house for however much time, eating, stealing stuff, stealing little things or whatever and then he would leave. - How was he not caught based on fingerprint evidence? - Well, he didn't leave his fingerprints. He always wore a mask. He always had gloves on. This was an offender that did everything to prevent himself from being caught. - [Reporter] The golden state killer has been linked to at least 12 murders, 50 rapes and a string of burglaries throughout California. - All right, how's it going? - How you doing? - Good. - So we supply DNA sequencing solutions to the forensic laboratories that process crime scene DNA. At a crime scene, there's typically less than a nanogram of DNA left and it's usually degraded, right? So it breaks down. - Why is there so little? at a crime scene? A nanogram? - Yes. - That's insane. - Yes. - There's no accident that he stops in 1986. 1986 is when the first DNA case of a murder case is actually solved with DNA and he's, I think he's following that and he's saying, you know what, what I'm doing here, I'm leaving my DNA. I can't do this anymore. - [Reporter] Investigator Paul Holes tracked the golden state killer for decades. - He couldn't it account for DNA technology and that really was his big mistake. That was the critical mistake. He left his DNA all over California. And it turns out that in three of the cases, I had three sexual assault kits and that's where I got the golden state killer's DNA from Northern California. - But having the unknown killer's DNA wasn't enough. They needed to match it to a known sample. In 1990, the FBI started work on what would become a national genetic database. It mainly stores DNA profiles from convicted criminals and persons of interest. It's called the combined DNA index system or CODIS for short. In each of your cells, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, one from your mom and one from your dad. And at particular places on some chromosomes, there are short sections of DNA that repeat like A A T G, A A T G, A A T G, and so on. These are called short tandem repeats or STRs and different people have different numbers of repeats. Forensic labs produce STR profiles by counting up the number of repeats at each location. Initially, there were only 13 places on the DNA where STRs were counted, but in 2017 that was expanded to 20. It feels to me like that's not that much information. - It isn't. - But the chances of two people having the exact same number of repeats at all locations is incredibly small. The CODIS database now contains over 18 million STR profiles. - The golden state killer's DNA profile has been up at the national DNA database that's run by the FBI called CODIS since 2001 and has been searching ever since with no hits. We did Interpol searching, trying to search other country's DNA databases thinking well, maybe he came from a out of the country that's why after all this time we have yet to be able to identify him and obviously we didn't get any hits. - But genetic sequencing technology was advancing rapidly. - [Female Reporter] The genome project was completed. Since 1986 scientists had been mapping and sequencing the three billion nucleotides contained in the human genome. It's anticipated that - Soon private companies began offering genetic tests directly to consumers and they provide far more genetic data than what's in the CODIS database. I traveled to Houston, Texas to visit Family Tree DNA headquarters. - We'll go in the lab and we'll start talking about the life cycle of a sample. There you go. - Thank you. These samples, what are they? - So they're cheek cells. They just scrape the inside of their cheek, they put a cap on it and they send it back to us. - It's like a robot ballet. - Yes, so for DNA extraction, we need to remove all of the protections that are on the DNA and just separate it by itself so we can do testing on that. - Instead of looking at 20 places on your DNA, these tests examined 700 to 800,000. - The Family Finder test is based on what's called a micro array and this is what a micro array looks like. Each one of those boxes is an individual. We can fit 24 individuals on here. And within that box is about 710,000 positions of your DNA, that we're measuring, we're getting data for. - 710,000? - Yes, and they're called snips. - So hang on, that's like 710,000 individual bases, like ATGC? - Yes. - For each person, you can measure 24 on that single chip? - Correct. - The human genome consists of three billion bases. All people share about 99.9% the exact same DNA, which means on average, only about three million basis differ from person to person. These individual letter changes are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. So on there, are there a whole bunch of like little pieces of DNA then? - Yes, so what we have is a short piece of DNA that is specific to one SNP. So it's one position in the genome where we know there can be a difference. - Okay. Is there any example of a simple SNP that confers some sort of? - Actually blue eyes is a single base change. - Really? - Yeah. - So everyone with blue eyes has this one letter change? - mm hmm - You can see now it's starting to scan the first box. - The results of your 710,000 SNPs can tell you about your geographic ancestry or possible medical conditions, but they can also quantify how related you are to someone else. The genetics of having a kid are a bit like cutting two decks of cards together. The resulting deck will share about half its cards with each parent and there'll be long sequences of cards which match identically sequences in each parent. Now, if this deck has a kid, well then its offspring will share only about a quarter of its cards with each grandparent and the sections of identical cards will be shorter, and this is how it works with DNA. The more closely you're related to someone, the more DNA you share and the longer the blocks of identical DNA are. But to compare the DNA of two people, you don't need to read every letter. The snips are sprinkled throughout the DNA roughly every 2000 bases. So if you find long sections where the snips match up, you can bet that the DNA in between is identical too by comparing hundreds of thousands of snips sprinkled throughout the DNA, you can see where these identical blocks start and stop and so how much total DNA is shared. - Everywhere that is highlighted in blue is where I share DNA. - With your father? - With my father which is exactly what you expect because I should share DNA with him everywhere because he gave me 50% of my DNA. So this is a second to third cousin. I have no idea who this person is. And you can see here, we are definitely not as closely related as me and my dad because where the blue is, those are the only regions of the chromosome where we share DNA. - We all know that these genetic tests can help identify our relatives but the question is, can you do the same thing with law enforcement databases? Can you identify family members using the CODIS database? - You can and it's only limited to really first order and second order relatives. - That means if I'm looking for the golden state killer, I'm looking for either his father, his brother or his son. We did that over and over again with no hits. - Why is it so limited? - Because you've only got 23 loci. If you wanna do proper kinship analysis, you need to have more points assessed on that genome to see how related you really are. - We know the answer is behind a locked door and the answer is behind the locked door of 23andMe and Ancestry.com. We know that they have millions of profiles. Somebody related to him, a second cousin I would guess, would be in there. - Sure. - And that was very hard to deal with. You know, that the answer is there behind this locked door. - Law enforcement is not allowed to search the databases of 23andMe and Ancestry.com but luckily for investigators, there was another way. An independent website called GEDmatch had been set up to allow people to connect with relatives. You can upload the raw data from any of the big genetic testing companies and search for matches. - So when we initially search the GEDmatch database, our best hits come back at third cousins which means they shared you know, our top hit, I think shared about 1% of the DNA. It's very little DNA that's shared but that's a starting data point. And theoretically, by taking multiple of these individuals that share DNA and building their family trees using traditional genealogy and public source documents like census records and obituaries and newspaper articles and findagrave.com, you build this family tree back until you get two of these relatives of the golden state killer, you get them to intersect where now you see, oh, they've got, they share great-great grandparents together. Theoretically the golden state killer is a descendant from those same great-great grandparents. So once I identify that common ancestor, it's now identifying every single descendant from those great-great grandparents and this becomes a huge process. People in the 1840s would typically have 15 kids. You have to identify each of those kids and then all of their children and then all of their children. So now we have this exponentially growing family tree. - How wide did that tree get? - I think we had over 1000 individuals in that family tree but we knew a lot about our offender. We were confident he was born between 1940 and 1960. We knew he was a white male. We knew he was 5'8' to 5'10'. You know, he's in California. He's up in Sacramento in 1976. He's in Southern California in the '80s and we basically narrowed it down to about five males and then it's just investigations. - With a suspect at their fingertips, this spring, they followed him to a Sacramento area Hobby Lobby store and took a DNA sample from his car door handle. Days later, investigators recovered another DNA sample from one discarded tissue which registered a match to DNA evidence left at one of the crime scenes. - Investigators in California say DNA evidence led them to one of the country's most notorious serial killers. Former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested yesterday and he is believed to be the so-called golden state killer. - For 44 years, countless investigators have worked it and have failed to solve it. Within four and a half months, a team of six were able to figure out who the golden state killer was and that was Joseph DeAngelo. - After the golden state killer was identified, the flood gates opened and we were seeing every week not only single killers, but multiple killers, serial killers, every week were being identified from cases in the '70s and the '80s. - 'Cause, there's been over 70 cases now that they've solved this way and they continue to solve them at a fairly regular rate and I think - Presumably that rate's just gonna increase. - Yeah. - And there's gonna be more because it's working and we are going to help find these people. - But the scary thing is in the US, you have 100,000 cold case murders with DNA. You have more cold cases but the ones with DNA is estimated about 100,000 There's roughly about 650,000 sexual assaults, cold cases with DNA. - With DNA? It seems like a real paradigm shift. - It is. Multiple law enforcement agencies has said that this is the most revolutionary tool they've had since the adoption of the fingerprint. - With traditional DNA, it required getting a sample from the actual individual. It's a one-to-one type of process. And so these offenders who let's say they have committed crimes and haven't been caught and they're just living their life and they're thinking, well, my DNA has never been taken from me. I may have left DNA in the","In the mid-1970s, a prolific criminal known as the Visalia Ransacker began committing burglaries, which escalated to sexual assaults in Northern California as the East Area Rapist, and later, the Original Night Stalker in Southern California, before becoming known as the Golden State Killer. His crimes, spanning from 1976 to 1986, included over 50 sexual assaults, 12 murders, and numerous burglaries. The killer was never caught, largely due to his careful avoidance of leaving identifiable evidence, including fingerprints. In the 1990s, DNA technology emerged but failed to connect him to a known suspect. However, the use of genetic databases like GEDmatch and advancements in genetic sequencing led investigators to identify Joseph James DeAngelo in 2018 through familial DNA, resulting in his arrest. This breakthrough has since led to the resolution of many cold cases, revolutionizing the way law enforcement uses DNA to solve crimes."
