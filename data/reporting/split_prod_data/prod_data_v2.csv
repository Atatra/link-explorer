A PID identifies and locates an entity regardless of where it is hosted or published and enables its unambiguous and long-term identification. PIDs are an essential component of the research ecosystem, linking researchers and research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. In this blog post, we will explore the different types of PIDs, their applications, and how researchers can use PIDs to comply with the FAIR data principles and the funder requirements. Types of PIDs There are several types of PIDs commonly used in research, shown as follows. PIDs for People (Researchers): Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers (ORCID iDs) PIDs for Objects (Research Outputs): Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) PIDs for Places (Research Organizations): Research Organization Registry (ROR) IDs, and Crossref Funder Registry IDs ORCID iDs are assigned to researchers and support automatic links to their research outputs. ORCID iDs can be linked to a researcher’s affiliations, funding sources, and publications, making it easier to identify their contributions and track their research impact. DOIs are the most widely used PIDs assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, protocols, books, datasets, and software. DOIs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite digital objects, facilitating their discoverability, accessibility, and interoperability. RRIDs are unique identifiers assigned to research resources such as antibodies, cell lines, model organisms, and other tools (software, databases, services). RRIDs enable researchers to unambiguously identify and cite the research resources they use, facilitating reproducibility and reuse of research data. ROR IDs are unique identifiers assigned to research organizations, including universities, research institutes, and funding agencies. ROR IDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their affiliated organizations, making tracking research impact and identifying collaborations easier. Crossref Funder Registry IDs are unique identifiers assigned to funding agencies, allowing researchers to track the funding sources of their research outputs and demonstrate the impact of specific funding programs. Applications of PIDs to Comply with FAIR Data Principles PIDs are not only critical to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles but also to making data machine-readable or machine-actionable. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder IDs in research outputs, researchers can make data more easily discoverable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, and machine-actionable. Machine-actionable data means that data can be processed and understood by machines or software. PIDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata, making it easier to discover and access research data. PIDs also facilitate the reuse of research data or protocols by enabling researchers to easily cite and credit the sources of their data and protocols. PIDs also play a critical role in ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of research data. PIDs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite their research resources, facilitating the replication of experiments and ensuring the accuracy of research data. By incorporating PIDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their data more interoperable, allowing machines to process data and metadata more efficiently. PIDs follow established standards and enable data to be shared and reused without the need for transformations, making data more interoperable with existing and future systems. This facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources and enables researchers to make new discoveries that would not be possible without PIDs. In conclusion, PIDs play a critical role in research by enabling the unique identification, citation, and linking of research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder Registry IDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their research outputs more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR data principles) required by many funders and publishers and contribute to the open data ecosystem.

Also, new French Revolution Merch available now in the store, including King Louis and Marie Antoinette character pins, complete with detachable heads just like the real thing. (At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly Governor de Launay has defeated them, and has them on the run. No need to worry. - Uh, your Majesty Isn't that Governor de Launay's head on a pike? - Well... Clearly, Governor de Launay has taken on the form of a bodyless, pike-head deity and the people are so enamored with him, they're parading him around the city. No need to worry AT ALL. (quickly drives away) When the National Assembly heard about the violence that had taken place, they had two options: either one, they denounce it, and try to carry on the Revolution using peaceful means, or two, they say: 'Damn, you stuck his head on a pike? That's pretty hardcore, and WE LOVE IT! Incidentally, they went with option #2. Some historians believe this reaction paved the way for the utter violence and bloodshed that would become the legacy of the French Revolution. This widespread acceptance of violence during the Revolution is also largely accredited to the writings of a certain Jean-Paul Marat. A man of science, with a horrible skin condition that kept him confined to a bathtub. He began writing a radical newspaper he affectionately named: 'The Friend of the People' - Citizens of France, be very afraid Given the chance, the King and the nobility won't hesitate to massacre us all. The solution is simple: EXECUTE THEM! Kill every last one of them! Cut off a thousand heads, and if that isn't enough, CUT OFF A THOUSAND MORE! (rubber duck rises) Oh! Hey Mr. Squeaky. What are you doing down there? You're so cute! (squeezes duck) Awwww, I love you too, Mr. Squeaky. (kisses duck) Now where was I? Oh yeah...... Kill them all It became one of the most popular publications in Paris during the revolution, and succeeded in spreading ever increasing fear and anger among the people. In August, leaders of the National Assembly, with help from a certain Thomas Jefferson, adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen- an incredible document that guaranteed liberty and equal rights to all men. And when I say men, I mean men. (not women) Despite its glaring shortcomings in gender equality, the massively influential Declaration would go on to inspire the struggle for liberty and equality across the planet for centuries. However, back in France, the vast majority of the people weren't really so concerned with enlightened ideas of equality as much as they were concerned with the fact that they were still starving. Bread was still expensive as hell and hard to come by. The people felt that one reason that nothing had been done yet about the crisis was because the King simply couldn't see the problem. He lived in Versailles, a full 20 km southwest of Paris. And as a result, lived in comfort, separated from his dirty, stinking subjects. On October 5, a crowd of women, 7,000 strong, decided to do something unprecedented. They decided they'd remove that separation, and confront the king directly. The women marched all the way to the King's palace in Versailles. Along the way, the crowd continued to grow into the tens of thousands. And when they arrived, they demanded an audience with the King. - What are those 'things' outside the palace? - They're poor people, your Majesty - THAT'S POOR PEOPLE?!! - They say they're hungry. - Hungry? Then let them eat cake. - Wow. See, this is the exact BS that led to this whole mess in the first place. You're SO out of touch. They're writhing around in the filth breaking their backs to barely scrape by and they come to you demanding just the basic ability to feed themselves and you think a slice of cake will sort them out? - Well... then let them eat Taco Bell Crunch Wrap Supreme. - Wow! They're not THAT desperate! Members of the crowd actually managed to break into the palace with the intention of killing the Queen who narrowly escaped through a secret passage in her bedroom. The enraged mob killed several members of the Royal guard, and raised their head on pikes, which if you haven't noticed yet, is something they were quite fond of doing. The King had no choice, but to come out and talk to the crowd. He agreed to accept his new position, sharing power with the Revolutionary government and to return to Paris with the crowd, removing the separation between King and Subject. King Louis had a problem with people constantly raiding his palace. But one thing he didn't have a problem with was people raiding his computer- because he used NordVPN.

"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com. So, I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost. The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always count on YouTube monetization. So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component and this form of Zyklon B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust. (slow tense music) Thinking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain or as a hero for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would've figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air and other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it'd be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used. Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive. So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?",Intro Why did people want to know why some of the most important parts of our lives on earth on earth The Blue Danube,1,v2
" These are the 7 most powerful men in China. They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party... and their identities are revealed every five years... at a carefully choreographed political event called the National Congress. “China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership over the next five years.” The order of appearance is symbolic. The first person to emerge is the head of the party for the next five years. At the most recent event in October 2022... that person was Xi Jinping China's president for the last ten years... who walked out in the top spot a historic third time after getting rid of China's presidential term limit that restricted all his predecessors to two terms. A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life. The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this since Mao Zedong... the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China... whose ruthless dictatorship scarred the Chinese people for generations. Xi has been compared to Mao a lot. And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook. But there's something else that connects these two. When Xi was just a young boy... Mao ruined his life. Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing... ended up in exile. Condemned to hard labor in the countryside. 50 years later Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world and the only leader since Mao to have unchecked power over China. So how did he go from being banished in his country... to taking complete control of it?   Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed long before Xi was even born.  It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China. A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao gained influence over large swaths of mainland China... and controlled a communist military called the Red Army... that fought the Nationalist Party ruling the Republic of China at the time. At this point, the Communists were losing bad. The bulk of their army was pinned down here... in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao... now surrounded by Nationalist forces. And they were running low on food. So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack... to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly 130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here. On October 16th, 1934, they made their move... and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line. They broke through. And even though their numbers quickly dropped with thousands dying and thousands more fleeing to the countryside... around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on. This was the beginning of a year-long historic retreat called the Long March. The journey to establish a new communist base... far from the Nationalist forces. Mao, who used to be a military leader wasn't in charge at this time. He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war. But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted. The Long March changed that. After escaping the siege here the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks by the pursuing Nationalist army. The military leaders of the march had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy of direct confrontation... rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics. And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army. Less than half of the original escape group survived the first three months alone. So it was at this first stopping point where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai... handed military leadership back to Mao. And Mao picked an end point for the march... here. 800 miles away in rural northern China. But they didn't go straight for it. Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains where he predicted lighter resistance. And he was right. But the journey was still brutal. It was nine more months of nonstop marching and fighting along this several thousand mile route... before they ultimately arrived in northern China... where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge... bringing the Long March to an end. That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works. Officially, the highest level of authority is a group called the Central Committee and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions. Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials called the Political Bureau or Politburo. In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union... the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party besides the General Secretary. But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction that makes it unique. It has one more even smaller selection of top officials who ultimately have the final say. An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee. This group, which includes the General Secretary holds supreme control over the Central Committee dictates the will of the party and is in full control of the Central Military Commission which oversees China's defense. Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here in the highest position of the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party when the Long March ended in 1935... he officially became head of the party in 1943. With both the party and the military under his control... Mao began to exploit the system to ensure he remained at the top for the rest of his life. At Mao's first National Congress as the official party leader in 1945... the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence to a whole new level. They unified the party around a single understanding of its history... and declared Mao's political ideology later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism... as the unquestioned guiding principle of the Chinese Communist Party. Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions could no longer be challenged by anyone. It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time of the Politburo Standing Committee. The four other top party leaders... all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao. Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai... who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions in the future government. Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists in a decades long Chinese civil war and established a new country: The People's Republic of China, or PRC. “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker... now assumed the stature of a dominant figure in all of Eastern Asia.” But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country. Because now that you're running a country there's all these other things you have to do like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that. You can't possibly have the party do all these things. So the party set up a government that would take the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee and figure out a way to make them a reality. And so it evolved to a system where... the party would make all the important decisions... and especially the Politburo Standing Committee. Then, as it is today... many of these decisions would go to the State Council. So the State Council was the highest decision-making body on the state side, led by the Premier of China. The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions in the party in government. Whether they had government experience or not. For example, Zhou Enlai... the former party leader who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March... became China's first premier. The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him. The disadvantage of that is they didn't know what they were doing and so administration suffered... policy outcomes suffered. Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao. Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed Secretary General of the State Council... and as the son of a Long Marcher young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling. Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime. His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines and widespread persecution that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades... and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution. A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism. The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal. The way he viewed communist figureheads like Lenin and Marx before him. Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology was publicly humiliated... impoverished... excluded from society, and, in many cases executed. Either at the hands of the army... or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism: The Red Guards.  Even those closest to the dictator weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution. High level officials including members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Long Marchers... were removed from their positions. Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died while imprisoned under harsh conditions. Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army and replaced him with a Maoist... leaving no one left to oppose him in the military. Mao's handpicked successor who always appeared loyally by his side in photos and propaganda posters died under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union. Mao later denounced him as a traitor. He denounced Xi's father, too. This is a photo of Xi senior being restrained and publicly criticized by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution. He would remain a prisoner in Beijing for 8 years following this. With his father purged... Xi Jinping, 15 at the time was expelled from his elite school in Beijing and sent to work in the countryside. He had to live in a cave and do hard manual labor. His food was barely enough for a growing young person. And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it. But then... Mao died. The Cultural Revolution ended. His successor was Deng Xiaoping... one of the Politburo Standing Committee members who was removed from power during the Cultural Revolution. Who just before Mao died... started making a promise to fellow exiled party veterans. Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly... to all the surviving Long Marchers that he wanted to rehabilitate people. So when Mao died, they all supported the rehabilitation of Deng. And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated he went ahead and rehabilitated all these people. With experienced leadership back in place the party needed to figure out how to prevent something like this... from ever happening again. In order to undo Mao's cult of personality... the party introduced a second historical resolution in 1981. It condemned periods of Mao's rule... and emphasized a renewed commitment to collective leadership... vowing to oppose the consolidation of power around one person moving forward. The successors to Mao didn't want a dictatorship. So they divided up these positions and put them in the hands of different people. Like Mao, Deng kept tight control over the Central Military Commission as its chairman... and held a leadership position in the government. But was never head of state. He never held the highest position in the party either. Instead, he set up a new advisory commission and served as its chairman... which allowed him to influence the party's direction... without positioning himself directly on top of it. This allowed a power sharing structure while still making Deng the de facto leader of China until he stepped down in 1989... following the Army's massacre of students protesting in Tiananmen Square. “A protester suddenly ran into the middle of the street and in front of the oncoming tanks.” “Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire Chinese government... it had the real feeling of rebellion in the streets of Beijing.” “People want to fight the military out of their city.” Deng and his ideology which moved away from Maoism, set a precedent of sharing power. He opened up China and established economic ties with these countries... and was the first PRC leader to visit the US in 1979. “Today, we take another step in the historic... normalization of relations which we have begun this year.” Deng’s reforms became the foundation for decades of economic prosperity that led China to having the world's second largest economy over time... and being on the verge of becoming the world's next superpower. “Communism is creating a consumer society.” “Also reminds you that the standard of living in China is going up.” “Here... capitalism rules.” One thing power sharing did lead to... was a lot of policy innovation and then some degree of decentralization. And both of these things helped China's economy enormously. Which is why this period of economic growth and reform stretching over roughly 30 years is known as the Deng era. Whether he wanted to or not, Deng kept his word... and never tried to consolidate absolute power around himself. He did end up sharing power. And that set the stage for power sharing in the party... until the rise of Xi Jinping. So what was Xi doing all this time?  When Mao died in 1976 Xi was back in Beijing studying communist philosophy... even though the Chinese Communist Party had ruined Xi's family... He had joined it. Just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. But why? Personally, he might begrudge Chairman Mao for doing all this terrible things to his family... but I think at this time he also recognized that in the system of the Chinese Communist Party power is everything. Without power, you're nothing. But in order to get that power... Xi did something unexpected. He left Beijing. As his competitors were fiercely competing with each other in the 1980s and 1990s. He sort of got out of their way... and went to the provinces. He took positions in party leadership in rural, poor provinces all around China... where there were no other princelings to compete with. First, in Hebei, a poor rural province outside of Beijing... where he easily reached the top spot as party secretary. Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region where top members of the army were stationed. He moved up the ranks to party secretary here, too. Before becoming the governor of the province a few years later. After making powerful friends in the military... Xi went here... where he once again assumes the office of party secretary... and grew his support on the civilian side. This strategy of moving around didn't just give Xi a leg up in areas where competition was slim. It also gave him credibility... as a humble, hard working party leader... and he cultivated a growing group of supporters who would come back into play years down the line. It was his last stop and his shortest one that ultimately got him back to Beijing. A brief stint in the top party spot in Shanghai in 2007... where he rehabilitated the city's image following a high-level corruption scandal. Xi developed a reputation here as a prudent leader who toed the party line. Just 7 months later, he finally returned to Beijing... having been promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Basically, the people who were deciding on top leadership at the time they wanted a Princeling. But they didn't want a princeling who was too ambitious or too strong. So Xi Jinping he was seen as less ambitious because he was willing to go to the countryside and work in lower-level positions. When Xi emerged as the 2007 National Congress and leadership unveiling... he was one of the 9 most powerful men in the country. It was at this moment that his strategic climb... over 17 long years in the countryside paid off. Big time. When the General Secretary stepped down in 2012... Xi emerged at the top spot in the party as China's leader. Now the elite son of a former revolutionary turned exiled peasant... turned party darling... was poised to seize control of everything. Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes that rallying around a single figure is crucial to the party's survival. Rather than the collective leadership Deng’s reforms had normalized. So pretty much as soon as Xi Jinping came to power. He started getting rid of people. “The news... four top officials removed for taking bribes was announced on state TV.” “Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.” “Just sacked his defense minister.” “He sacked a whole lot of other people at the top of the military establishment.” “The former security czar has not been seen in public for more than a year.” “The nvestigation against Zhou allows the Chinese president to remove those opposed to his reforms.” He launched a major anti-corruption campaign... as soon as he took power in late 2012, early ‘13... which led to the arrests of hundreds of senior-level officials as well as military officers. These purges targeted Xi's rivals in the party... whose vacant positions he filled with his own supporters. After this massive purge... Xi Jinping was in very tight control over both the party and also the Chinese military... thereby making him the most powerful leader of the Chinese Communist Party since the death of Mao. That pattern continued in the second term where he unveiled 5 new faces of the Politburo Standing Committee... three of them with close personal ties to Xi. In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his most dramatic acts yet... to enforce his influence over the Chinese Communist Party. He introduced a third historic resolution that unified the party's ideology around one clear line of thinking: Xi Jinping Thought. Xi's personal political ideology... would now be the core in the party's thinking... political stance and action. Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas could no longer be challenged. And they weren't for many years. During Xi's first 10 years in power the size of China's economy more than doubled. So did average individual income. So did military spending. Under his leadership... China's presence on the world stage has grown too. Positioning the rising superpower to take on the role of an aggressor, externally. Reasserting claims over parts of the South China Sea Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet and stripping democratic process in Hong Kong. Inside its own borders strict Internet censorship and surveillance are widespread... and oppression of Uyghurs... a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group... is marked by human rights abuses. But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw the first real challenge to his authority. “Anger in China is growing.” “Video showing protester is in Xinjiang... fed up with China's zero Covid rules.” “The boldest public challenge yet for leader Xi Jinping.” With these protests all around the country... and the party's reputation in peril. Xi reversed the failed policy. But is now faced with a shaky economy... and cracks in his unchecked authority. It was just weeks before the widespread protests at the 20th National Congress in 2022... that Xi walked out in the leading position a third time. He had already locked in the presidency for another five years... and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee completely packed with those loyal to him. After removing the final senior members of the party that had ties to his predecessor. Now there is no one left in party or military leadership whose ideology differs from Xi. I don't think anyone can push him out at this point. I think Xi will be the most powerful leader in China... as long as he's alive and conscious. Thanks so much for watching this episode of Atlas.
