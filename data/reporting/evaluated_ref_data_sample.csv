hey yall dixie here today i want to tell you why i thank everybody and i mean everybody should go backpacking for three weeks Music i really want everybody in the world to go on a thru hike but i understand that its not feasible for most people to step aside from lifes responsibilities for a three to six month period depending on the type of through hike you go on uh also i know somebodys gonna point it out yes i realize that if literally every person in the world tomorrow decided to go on a thru hike that it would be very detrimental to the trails and other natural places but this is my dream world so in my imaginary dream world i do wish that everybody could escape for that type of experience so i was thinking to myself what is a more reasonable amount of time that i think somebody could step away and go on a backpacking adventure and still gain maybe half or maybe even a little bit more of the benefits of a thruhike without wrecking their life structure or their bodies because to be honest at the end of a six month through hike most people are in pretty rough shape physically and maybe a bit malnourished etc so in thinking about this i ended up landing on three weeks so i want to run you all through building up to that three week period some benefits that i think somebody could gain from being out on a backpacking trip for three weeks first lets start with day hacking i feel like so many people sell day hiking short i see it all the time in the homemade wanderlust backpacking forum group on facebook where people say well i havent backpacked yet im just a day hiker but day hiking is an awesome way to get out get some exercise fresh air etc and its the first step into making that transition into backpacking and in fact day hiking can even help with depression and probably anxiety too theres a study that ill link to in the video description below where a group of people who went out for a 90minute period into nature to walk about showed a decrease in activity in a region of the brain thats linked with depression as opposed to those who went for a 90 minute walk about in a more urban setting with traffic going by and they did not show the same reduction now if the only way that you can get out and exercise is to walk around the block in your neighborhood with cars going by thats still getting out getting exercise and in my opinion better than just sitting on the couch but if you can find a way to break off into nature youll find your mind being a bit more peaceful and it can even help with depression anxiety etc now lets talk about that first overnight backpacking trip this is really where i think people are able to wrap their mind around the possibility that hey i am actually capable of backpacking and if i can do one night why cant i possibly do more and the way that this happens is you get a huge confidence boost from going on an overnight trip from knowing that you planned this thing where you put hopefully everything that you need into a pack you went out into the woods and then you came back home alive first of all you were able to actually fit everything you need into a pack to live and then second of all you know you actually made it happen and if things didnt go perfectly as planned which oftentimes they dont you were able to roll with the punches and make it work anyway and then i think that a lot of adults dont realize how afraid of the dark they actually are until theyre sleeping in a tent in the woods by themselves because at home in your comfort zone where you control the atmosphere around you might not be afraid of the dark but in a tent in the dark in an area that you dont control in the wilderness i mean every caterpillar sounds like a grizzly bear outside of the tent so just that whole experience i think can really open peoples minds and and make them realize like hey i can do this and its rewarding and if i can do it for one night i can probably do it for more also i think in a short of a period of time of one to a few days the reality of quiet time can can really weigh on you and it might help you see if you are super addicted to social media or your phone or just not good at spending time alone it can really show you your weaknesses in that area because especially if youre in an area that doesnt have cell reception or you put it in airplane mode and say im just going to do this for myself and step away from everything i think youll find yourself reaching for your phone or you know like oh man i wonder what everybodys doing on facebook right now or i wonder what my friends are doing but im here stuck in this quiet time by myself but thats a very good and healthy thing and i think something that we should do more often now lets talk about the one week period or whatever period it really takes for you to have to do a resupply i dont like to carry more than five days of food so in a week period i would have already had one resupply if possible but having to resupply i think really changes things because now youre a stinky wild animal emerging from the woods and you have to go back into civilization and not just to your car to your home where you can shower and get what you want to eat but actually to a different place a different town where you have to rely on the kindness of others to get to town by putting your thumb out in the wind for me hitchhiking for the first time was a very humbling and really embarrassing experience because i had never been on that side of things i always had a friend that could give me a ride if i needed one or my own vehicle so to have to put myself out there to strangers really kind of turned the tables and put me on the other side of a situation that i had never been in given i put myself in this situation but still it helped me see things possibly from other peoples perspective and in the future you know i thought to myself maybe ill be a little less judgmental or a bit more kind to strangers instead of assuming things about them and just realizing this person is in a place where maybe they need some help so you know im more likely in the future to give it to them after ive put myself in that situation also once you go in town for a resupply you realize how inconvenient not having transportation is because youve got to go to a place and check in so you can bathe and and sleep for the night and maybe charge up your electronics if youve got a camera phone etc but you also need to do laundry so you have a choice if the place that youre staying at doesnt have laundry of doing what i call shower laundry and washing everything by hand there at the place youre staying or you have to walk to a laundromat but its not even as simple as that because you might have to get soap from a store or change from a store thats not near the laundromat or near the place that youre staying so while youre taking a day off you may have to do a lot of walking around the town to really get everything done that you need to do so you really start to appreciate those little things at home like a car or money for gas to put in the car to make life more convenient through navigating all these logistics of leaving trail going and doing all the things you need to do and then returning to trail i i think again that you get a pretty big confidence boost in that almost every time i get back on trail after doing a resupply im like okay somehow i managed to make all of that happen you know and it worked this time hopefully it continues to work in the future and i mean it always does one way or another but theres just kind of a rush to that and again i think you you kind of pat yourself on the back for making it work and also feel a good bit of gratitude for the people who were willing to help you and make it actually happen now lets talk about two weeks because i think somewhere around the twoweek period maybe going on into the third the physical game starts to change at this point you have pushed through pain and suffering every day i know especially the first few days id get out of the tent just be like oh my gosh like im just so sore im suffering im not used to this weight on my back or doing this many miles and at this point youve pushed through that and youre starting to see some delayed gratification of keeping working at it and you start to feel better maybe the miles are coming a little bit more easily and i hesitate to use that word because for me the miles never feel easy i just do them a little bit faster than i did before but anyway youre pushing through that and if you do a shorter hike than that typically its its kind of a suffer fest to some extent so at this point you finally get to get past that but on the flip side of that i feel like week two is where the mental game gets a little bit tougher and things start getting a little bit heavier mentally because you know its not as exciting as when you first start out and at this point some of the days might start to feel a little bit monotonous or you know the same youre really missing the comforts of home and being able to have food whenever you want it and certain food whenever you want it youre missing your bed you know maybe your friends family etc things just start to get a little bit tougher and not only the missing of the things that you have back home but by week two some of the thoughts from the past probably start surfacing for myself on the at once the newness of the idea kind of started to wear off when i was alone and hiking all of the things that i didnt want to think about started coming to mind first maybe past relationships or arguments i had or things that i did in the past that you know i wasnt proud of and i talked to nimble well nomad about this while i was through hiking on the penhody trail when i met him at flag mountain and he said well dixie you just started to realize what a jerk you really are and i was like oh my gosh yes exactly i did you know i was just ashamed of myself in a lot of ways and he says of course all of us that do long miles go through that you have to realize what a jerk you are accept it and then love your jerk self anyway so i think a lot of this can start happening by week two or however long it takes for the newness to wear off also by week two because youve had the physical stresses you finally started to get past those and now youre going through the mental stresses somewhere between all of that physical and mental stuff youre probably gonna have a toddler fit but thats a good thing because youre working through the idea that you cant control every situation sometimes its gonna rain and the winds gonna blow and your stuffs gonna get wet and your feet are gonna hurt and then youll stub your toe on a rock and just get really pissed off about it but thats good because i do think its important for people to realize you can put a lot of anger into this situation but its not gonna change it so maybe youre better suited to put your time energy and effort into things that you can change or that you can control and maybe learn to just deal with some of that other stuff that you cant control or change three weeks i feel like at this point most people tend to have worked through their physical ailments i mean you could still get an injury or something like that but the typical aches and pains also the mental side of things have probably calmed down a little bit starting to get into the groove and really enjoy being in the here and now and people have even said they feel at that point it becomes more of a meditative experience of going down the trail and maybe youre not thinking of all the the bad things anymore but having good thoughts and and maybe even thinking about reprioritizing things in life or ways that you can improve your life when you get home so things just kind of take a positive turn mentally and physically i think at this point also at three weeks i think people really start to fall in love with freedom if thats something that they appreciate because most people dont really have many freedoms in their lives and i know you think well yes i do because i can pretty much go get whatever food whenever i want it or whatever products at the store but the structure of many peoples lives in general is the formula thats forced on us by society when were little kids you know you grow up you go to high school you go to college you get a job and you work until you retire or die and thats pretty much the end of it so being out on the trail for this long of a period of time and waking up when you want to structuring your days how you want to oh you decided that you want to take the afternoon off and sit and watch this waterfall go for it at this point there just seems to be a perspective shift where its like wow i really like the taste of freedom and maybe when i get back home im gonna try to start incorporating more of that into my life because the truth is if we dont design our own lives somebody else will do it for us also at that three week mark youll probably start feeling a little bit more at one with nature because youve observed the animals around you in your particular area youve learned their patterns youve learned their noises youve started to maybe identify some of them or take pictures so you can identify them later so you kind of get into a groove with your surroundings and realize that youre also an animal just out in nature having a good old time if youve been out backpacking for a three week period then youll have probably done several resupplies at that point and worked through the humiliation of stinking and not looking your best when you go into town on the at for a while i kind of felt embarrassed if i would go out and have a drink on a friday night at a resupply town because id see all these girls fixed up with makeup on and hair to a tee you know looking like knockouts and and there i was my grungy hiker clothes you know probably with some residual stink to me and it was just a little bit embarrassing because its like whats wrong with this girl you know can she not afford better clothes or does she not care about how she looks but after going through several resupplies and experiencing that im like man im out here having fun with all these other hacker people ive met or maybe some locals if i didnt see any other fellow hikers in there and im having just as much fun as these people that spent hours getting dressed and scrubbed up to go out and im not saying that theres anything shameful about wanting to look nice or putting on perfume to go out but im just saying that it its not a prerequisite to enjoying your life and having fun now if youve been hiking alone for this three week period at first if youre not a typical loner it probably drove you crazy but at three weeks youre probably getting a bit more used to that and maybe even enjoying that alone time with yourself but if youve been hiking with others youve probably seen how quickly you can get attached to people you meet on trail and and how youll talk to them about your bathroom schedule but maybe somebody that youve known several years you know you wont even poot in front of them so its just crazy how things are so different on trail and if youve been around other hikers maybe youve run into some people that dont have the same beliefs as you but youve realized wow we can actually coexist and still have fun hanging out around a campfire and talking about things like civilized adults instead of screaming and cussing at people on facebook you know because thats how people are influenced or perspectives are changed is sitting down and having a meaningful conversation with somebody not preaching on social media or screaming and yelling at people and also after a three week period i think that you will find once you do get home to your wonderful bed and everything in your comfort zone how much crap you have that you dont need and youll probably want to throw away a lot of things because once youve gone that long with having everything that you need right there at your fingertips youll realize that everything else is just maybe a bit excessive and finally i think at that three week period you might start to realize that you can be grateful for the little things and and be grateful for what you have because after having several resupplies where you just have to take what you can get instead of being able to fix up all these you know super awesome backpacking meals that you homemade or that you bought online or whatever because when you go out for three to five day period or maybe even one week you can take whatever you want from home but when youre thrown out there and you just have to resupply whatever store you can find you learn to be appreciative for what you can get so anyway if youve never been backpacking for three weeks then i challenge you to try to make time to go do that and if you cant step aside for three weeks a day hike a few day hike a week hike two week hike whatever you can get out and make happen for yourself i think that youll find when you come out of the woods youll be a better person physically mentally i mean sure you could hurt yourself or something along the way or you might be sore but ive never come out of the woods a worse person or in worse shape mentally at least emotionally spiritually than when i went in and even if things dont go as planned again those are learning experiences and growing experiences and i think that all of that does make us better people so if you have been backpacking for a three week period or less or even more than that i would love for you to share in the comments below some things that you noticed in yourself and maybe thatll encourage other people to get out there and try it out for themselves thank you all so much for watching dont forget to subscribe before you go if you

seeds every gardener needs them to grow but what are the best online websites to get them in todays video im going to be teaching you guys the websites i use to get my seeds this year thats going to include the seed quality the prices per seed and then the seed packaging and how they look and how the whole experience kind of came together the main difference between buying seeds online compared to a physical store is that a physical store such as home depot wont have the variety of seeds that you would get online between all the websites that i suggest for you guys today youre going to be able to pretty much get any vegetable any flour any herb anything for your garden now lets get into it Music my name is devin the channel is prepping to survive and im here to learn how to garden with you guys in 2020 i created this channel because i went to the grocery store and there was no canned beans to buy it made me realize what would happen if food wasnt available i decided to garden my own food and dive headfirst into youtube and make videos of what ive learned along the way if you guys want to follow me on my gardening journey and grow with me then consider prepping that like button until it turns blue subscribing lets get on with the video the one thing i always look for for any online seed website is that its very easy to navigate so i want to be able to find my herbs my vegetables my flowers it should be simple i think itll be the same for you guys so the second thing as well is i like to have under each vegetable that im buying i want the website to display a picture of what im buying at full maturity so say im buying broccoli i want to see what the broccoli should look like at full maturity so i kind of know what to expect without further ado here are my favorite websites to buy seeds so the first website is william dam seeds damseescom and they focus on old and traditional style of gardening thats why youll see on their seed packages it looks more retro so be like a 1960s magazine style look there are a few things that stand out the most to make william dam seeds my number one pick one is the simplicity of the website its extremely easy to navigate they dont try to upsell you anything else they dont advertise its just overall a very good user experience at the very top you can see their menu therell be vegetables flowers and herbs and one of the best features with this website is if you hover over vegetables theres going to be a drop down menu of all the vegetables that theyre selling second when you do click on something such as tomatoes youll be able to filter through categories such as bush paste or cherry tomatoes i havent really seen that on too many other seed company websites or at least the filters arent as easy to find i planted their seeds last year and i had zero issues with the germination rate and the seeds grew really nicely as far as the price i will say dam seeds is a bit more expensive than the average seed company but their website does have a greater selection of seeds available than most of the online seed companies that i have i have searched up so the seed packaging is pretty simple with design kind of concept but theyve got the name of the crop which is this is kale theyve got a little description right below the picture of the crop and then on the back theyve got kind of what is kale any health benefits a description of the actual crop and then right below that theyve got the how to grow sections so they give you instructions on how to grow temperatures they grow in they give you just kind of a general growing instructions fairly detailed for what ive seen and then right below they have approximately how many seeds you have the germination rates which for this is 99 which is crazy good and then pack tested for and the year so out of all three companies i say this is the best and most detailed seed package i bought so the second website that i bought from this year is seeds now seeds nowcom seeds now is a family owned and operated company and they started their company to promote organic and selfsustaining lifestyles one of the coolest things with seedsnowcom is they put together a variety pack of seeds and a seed bank so that is if you want to make salsa they have a salsa variety pack of seeds so everything youll need to make salsa with they put all the seeds together and then with seed banks one of the features is they have a fall and winter seed bank so every single crop that does well in cold weather they have that all the seeds put together for you and they have a bunch of different varieties so thats just makes it a lot easier for anyone to order once they come to the website the website itself is easy to navigate they do promote a few more of their own products but thats to make deciding easy for you guys plus at the top they give you two ways to search for what you want you can do it either alphabetically or you can use the drop down menu and do it that way if you are on a budget this year for your seed purchases then seeds now is one of the best websites to order from they have 99 seeds theyre the cheapest seeds i have found across all the websites the only downside for how cheap the seeds are is the germination rate was a bit lower at 85 but it wont be a problem because you just have to sow a bit more seeds when you start planting as far as the seed packages theyre very basic its just a piece of plastic a plastic bag with the seeds in it the information on the plastic bag isnt much but on the seeds now website it does a great job at giving additional information when you click on the seed varieties overall seeds now is a great quality company with quality seeds for an extremely good price and i highly recommend them the last and final company that im recommending in this video is hudson valley seeds which they focus on heirlooms and open pollinated seeds if you guys are into art at all then hudson valley seeds puts together these things called art packs and its just artists across the united states that have custommade these seed packages for the variety of seeds and any artist can submit them its an open call that was one really cool thing that i found on the hudson valley seeds website the website also is extremely easy to navigate at the very top youll see vegetables flowers and herbs like the rest with the drop down menu and from there you can just click on what you are looking for with a great selection of seeds with the pricing proceed its average its not expensive or cheap another really great feature with hudson valley seeds is when you do click on say a vegetable such as tomato again when you go to the page they do have at the very top theyll have a filter for the different types of tomatoes such as slicing tomatoes cherry tomatoes paste tomatoes or dried tomatoes overall the seeds that ive used from the website have been high quality they germinate properly and theyre exactly what you purchase for this video i only covered three of my top seed company websites for this year some honorable mentions is my gardener hes a fellow youtuber he gives some extremely good information on his videos you guys definitely should check them out another one is johnnyseescom they give a bunch of information on growing from their website theres bakers creek heirloom seeds which focuses on heirloom seeds and west coast seeds these are just a few theres many many more but i thought id mention a couple more options for you guys what ive learned from ordering seeds through the year whether you buy the same broccoli from one website to another doesnt really matter too much its the variety that each website offers with seats yes i will admit that i do buy from the same companies because i know that they have a certain seed that i really like enjoy and they deliver a solid product and have always treated me well and one thing to keep in mind is the best time to buy the seeds is fall or early winter and that way that youll have a bigger variety of seeds to choose from nothing will be sold out thank you guys for watching this video and joining me on my gardening journey hopefully i helped you guys choose where to buy your seeds this year i will have a link to all the websites and the honorable mentions in the description below so you guys can choose where you want to buy your seats until next video;Intro Prepping to Survive Intro What I Look For When I Purchase Seeds Online William Dam Seeds Review Canadian Company Retro Seed Packages Seeds Now Review

Music well greetings hello and welcome back episode number 17 of Imperial Jedi and say some said actually its all about buses kind of a fun one where do I begin lots to show you actually some really cool ideas in the doc hit were gonna be going over some different types of bus routes Ill show you some really cool ways to implement some fun front little neighborhood ones and hopefully show you guys some cool stuff you didnt know but the buses yet and its gonna be kind of a fun segue into Metro and the next episode will be like Metro and that kind of stuff right but lets start off with buses and well see some yeah cause and effect so cool stuff on the docket just number one guys just kind of that remember like whats the crowd like over here alright just keep in mind that it is manageable at the moment were gonna kind of see like whats about to go not wrong but see what happens we start linking some areas together lets Im gonna test it some stuff out here so I try to do spoilers but I have an idea as to whats gonna happen hopefully alright so we do have some preexisting bus lines over here so well lets let these things do their own thing whats going to end up happening though is were actually gonna link up a few more buses interestingly enough down here where some of our other bus traffic kind of goes through between the university in that quadrant and we actually see a massive increase in people up there then what kind of talk about it powered to deal with that and just overall what Im gonna do is create an express route that links the western edge of the town over here just over to the university area and like where the transit hub will be going down and well kind of see like the effect on that and Im gonna create a couple neighborhood routes here to give you some inspiration on how to do your own and lets talk about transit just in general so hopefully we have some fun here not sure how long this episode will be but I kind of feel like when I get to the end thatll be like however long it needs to be you know so well see probably not to be the longest ones though and again just kind of gear in more towards transit so not too much building just transit talking okay so actually lets start off very first by doing something kind of cute fun over here in this neighborhood all right well Im off to a great start forgot water for these people last time well theyre right along start again here okay so what I want to do is create a fun little school bus route you take yourself school buses yeah for sure so what I want to do is go over to our neighborhood grab ourselves the bus and just find where the school is right over here and this is not going to be the most efficient route this is just more like for some visual fun we do actually get some people using this for its intended purpose which is nice so youll see students queuing at the bus stop youll see them get on the bus and youll see them get off at at the school very simple nice little neighborhood looped through here stop in pretty much all four corners making the detour of course for the school and Id argue that these guys here could probably walk if they wanted to right but this type of route you dont really want to use this too often in larger areas were four really any other reason than just kind of a cute little community feel like this and the reason being lets say for example youre at the school and you lived here you never have to take the route the entire way not to back to this a short route right but this kind of stuff would not really work too well on like massive city planning you know if you live two blocks the other way you know you dont want to spend two hours on the bus right it just doesnt work alright so what we want over here is school buses this is kind of a cool thing may not know about this make sure your game is fully updated sometimes I get people who ask like why do I have four panels and stuff sometimes the DLC is what brings it often if you just buy the game and havent updated it yet youre kind of missing out on cool stuff thats kind of happened along the way so were gonna transit were gonna click on our line and over here we can actually change the model over so ever to make this one a school bus and then over here you can see zero out of three vehicles now theyre spawning this shows capacity and the spacing in between are stops this is a five stop line thank you it looks like it also shows how many people are waiting in each stop which is kind of cool and these are the theoretically the people are gonna get around the neighborhood or take the bus to school thats thats kind of cute so we can cut back on neighborhood traffic give more of a lift in feel bring the realism index make of school buses now and then you expect a few neighborhoods together and we could do the same thing with this school over here at the high school lets just do that for the moment just to kind of give you guys the the idea right but you want to do it elsewhere in the city totally feel free and dont worry about changing the color of the line which you can do via this panel here the bus will always be that school bus yellow and Ill try and track down a couple those in just a second but I want to do right now though is just kind of create a fun like neighborhood line going through this neighborhood here and what Im essentially going to do is eventually run some more lines down this main road here and I want to encourage some line sharing so were gonna get everyone in this neighborhood the very quick easy ability to get to this road here and this road is gonna have some shopping its gonna have more bus lines going through it eventually so I have Metro so its kind of a fun way to connecting everything together like when youre building your city bus lines you dont really need like one line going through the whole city right it doesnt really doesnt work you get some weird bottlenecks too so instead of you have is a few bus networks a few bus lines different types of transit all kind of working together as a team lets stop here near the hospital thats important this one its back way here and I would make the argument that like the buses should go closer to the highdensity because thats where youll get the most bang for your buck and by that same you know same flip of the coin highdensity works best with Metro you need people there to come it justify to spend you know sought you bet I think the people in the dead center here and theyre just kind of like arguably far enough that they kind of maybe walk anywhere possibly hopefully walk down this way to but if we notice that theres not enough usage here we might maybe link one more small bus through now youll probably notice its the exact same type of bus that I told you not to do in the other zone right thinking yourself Imperial you talk about here alright so what were gonna do is create a second line that goes the exact same route but opposite direction and that basically covers and tackles that problem youre running them to earlier for like you know how do you get to the two stops the other direction without taking the whole line you do this of course and youll notice as well all these buildings benefiting from it for you to get the highest level for some of your condo towers offices that kind of stuff they need public transit its just the missing the missing link and only that like the benefits are so good you end up with better traffic in your neighborhood get more of your city connected like pollution goes down noise pollution goes down which is like super key and then yeah Im going for a uniform bus fleet color so Im doing like bread if you are looking to get the same color but its not like an easy one to find like that you know just be patient the two lines when theyre next to each other pretty easy way to do it but just go for the same ballpark you know just kind of adjust as you need rain so I think of your patience you get pretty close or like relatively convincing its not so bad but for easy stuff right like kind of a color gradient that its like easy to reproduce or one thats like super easy to do this so top right corner you know okay now what were gonna do is run another bus through this part of the neighborhood were gonna be mindful of how the tram wants to go through here and were gonna try and get it to link up with this and maybe even stop through through part of this and then it just kind of like out linking all of these together and you start with buses you dont have to start with metro and then well just look and see like what routes are starting to get full and then we can maybe replace one of the busier routes for the metro thats going to be the end segue anyway all right well you got the idea of that so lets do a different type of route that maybe falls back on itself so it does the same idea of this but its only one line instead of two and maybe we can have it go through that middle section here just to encourage a little bit more sharing and ideally what Id like is just somewhere and we could use the roundabout I guess right okay this is a fun way lets do it this is gonna go a different direction than the the tram here but its encouraged some fun sharing okay so I want that going into here great and the goal is just to make it over to here so we can encourage line sharing so that way if you live over here you can take the bus to here switch on over and now you can get to a work zone and were doing it in a direction thats going to be kind of the opposite sort of of the SRAM so these guys can kind of work together now two games each other you dont really need like you know a tram a bus and a subway all going in the exact same direction because like you know whats the point about right so why use the roundabout as our hope turn open your mind thats going to you but never mind we can still if you want to yeah lets do that like the idea that roundabout and then oh you know what because of the way yeah try to do it over here so the buses are still close enough that I definitely make the argument they would 100 walk so our line sharing is still happening its just kind of a find the fun way back through here this is cool because of the way the one ways are right yeah its kind of a fun thing this is not really what I wanted to do because of the way the one ways are but principally same kind of idea whos getting sick here now youd was probably noise fun tidbit if youre just joining us for the first time and youre still making still enjoy the episode still here use offices as a sound barrier will be pleasantly surprised into the offices help just completely neutralized I got I was kind of gamble and peple those guys there right but just look at the difference you know start contrast there so offices can be sometimes the deciding factor then upgrades roads to have trees as well okay well lets put on three speed lets get some of these buses moving around now lets change this color over Im gonna show you one more example of a bus line that kind of falls back on itself because I think you kind of get the idea but this wasnt like really what i 100 wanted you know this is really awesome okay so lets head over here and do a quick little neighborhood one and um you know we could do actually is have one leave from the university Im done that yet so create a new line just leave through here lets see yeah principally the idea is we fall back and we hit the other side of the street using the exact same route and its as if we were doing that same trick from before with the two bus lines but just one bus line now theres that so thats kind of like a neighborhood bus line thats kind of like a bigger version of neighborhood bus line if you only think of like school versus what we just did and then now here because were connecting some stuff together well see just more overall usage Im gonna create one more style of the bus route which is basically an express and thats like a point A to point B with no stops in between so I want that one to kind of go from here to the universitys own kind of have that just to go in between the two streets even yeah up here to be nice and I remember at the very beginning of the episode I told you to keep an eye on like the traffic that we had going to and from the bus there listen sneaky peek and see whats whats happened now that weve connected more zones and encouraged overall more traffic I mean Express this can be a different color a dark blue thats cool okay so were keep it on three speed just for the sake of like you know letting the numbers crunch here well lets head back to that initial zone whats happening with our people and its already starting its already starting look at how many more people are starting to come over here and the reason is now its more attractive to leave your car at home you can get so much more like done on the bus right public transit is the number one look at this oh my goodness this is actually become an alarming so weve essentially opened the floodgate you can see this bus is gonna be full before oh yeah and this problem its only going to get worse thats not a bad thing though what were basically saying to ourselves here is we need Metro now something we could do for fun which wont really solve the problem but we could upgrade this to be a tram and we could do that in stages now that Im going to actually do the Train but hypothetically if you want to kind of tell the story maybe we could make this into a trolley bus first you know if the trolley bus becomes popular that could be the justification for making it into a tram we already have the overhead catenary cables like the wires ever you know and the tram bus is I mean if it werent for like a train bus the trolley buses if youre going for a green city vibe trams and trolleys are incredible lets get rid of that yeah trams trolleys they run on the electric grid and if your electric grid is completely green powered if you like solar and that kind of stuff like thats a green city you know you dont need those big big old honkin and heavy polluting buses use the biofield if you got the green citys DLC and use trolley buses so for fun lets upgrade this I dont think its gonna solve the problem the trolley buses basically have the same capacity as the regular buses but you know for fun and in yeah City just might not have the infrastructure or budget to just start out right away with trams or trip she might have to kind of spread the cost out and so if youre after a city that has that like real city vibe natural progression kind of to it maybe this is kind of the way to tell that story and then you know there might not be enough people to justify doing a metro so maybe a you know a tram would be more than enough start with the trolley go to the tram kind of like a case study then well kind of see like I dont think were gonna do this into a a tram I think Im gonna keep it a trolley but you never know so show you guys in the chat or or in the in the comments section want to see that conversion eventually now as far as I know you cannot upgrade a preexisting bus line and convert it to a tram I think its a Holly sorry I think its a redo it and then as far as I know the new hubs I dont think theres a way to get the the trolleys or the trams in through these and I think were actually at the point to where weve kind of outgrown that one so what I do is grab this put that just over here and Im gonna delete this building and go for the larger one now thats got the metro built into it which is gonna be kind of like the tiein TV end of the episode so I want the metro intercity thats the one here and Im actually gonna push this a little bit further down and before I do lets do this smidge inist of terraforming and were unfortunately lose a couple nice buildings here but all in the interest of development looking good symmetry where my try to justify this as progress on the name of progress now I just want this to be a flat spot here just with a parking lots and stuff look nice and the buses are kind of like interacting with it rather smoothly I do like the idea of introducing twoway traffic through here so we can get more use out of that bustling so Im gonna do an asymmetrical road that goes from here in cool and then well bring the bus line back up or the bus lane sorry and thats just now on oneway road thats gonna leave okay neck is a chance to read you that hopefully a little bit nicely like stuff you know its not its not permanent you can definitely redo things if you need to especially if the lines and stuff arent really driving thats so much better and just from our trial and error before right the longer things are the smoother theoretically they should be it was pretty good right there though yeah we almost got it this is again one of those arguments for like the movement mod it would just solve these problems in a split second but I do kind of want you know like Im willing to do this kind of stuff I dont mind as long as you guys are willing to watch it Im trying to make it boring this wont be like a 25 times re reshuffle you know but I just want to have like a big city by the end of it and then to be able to say that yeah you know we did this with vanilla you know you can do it that kind of mentality like I really want to have that definitely move in mod quality like mods would like to fix this stuff but I know we can do without it so hopefully we can find that fine balance I know it will eventually introduce it and convert some you guys into mod players but some just do not have the option you know no internet your on console computer just isnt upgraded yet cant do it thats clever straddling kind of both sides of the intersection so well hopefully get some cool ins and outs here alright so um were gonna be deleting the red roots thank you and were gonna replace that with a trolley buses Music okay so the depot I found this out looks absolutely wonderful over here and I shouldnt quit one way to replace that fully Music and that great oh yeah thats fantastic all right so I found that out by accident lets test and stuff that has to go there so the trolley bus depot its very noisy but fine in the mall you know we got the highway behind us for ok and then lets now make our route so were starting here going through the back here and it stops you know they have got to be like one to three blocks away just kind of part of like just thinking youre in real life like how far are you willing to walk in between stops realistically okay so I cant unfortunately have these two overlap I might be able to do yeah thats beautiful and I dont need the stop right there oh lets are heading back up I think the more of these youll do the more natural will start to feel your kindness look at the space and youll look at the traffic of the people going in and out and youll be like okay time to upgrade to metro time maybe run a different bus through here so lets try that and lets look at everything now together on three speed and then well find a way to like you know creatively like reduce people traffic but still increasing overall transportation footprint and that would be like a metro its over here I think suppress route this is probably holy smokes man alright so the Express route its great because it brings you deeper into the city and connects you to the rest of our transit options right its just like you know if we put a hundred more buses I dont think we make a dent so this right now that this is an absolute prime candidate for a metro can we keep the BAS sure we can do both you know theyll kinda like help help each other then the Express route I probably then justify maybe having one stop then you know so its slightly different than the metro but lets say for example we had a metro in this corner over here or maybe a little bit closer to on these guys here lets keep it below ground actually it works everything and just this a small little starter intro like Im not gonna make too many stops or that kind of stuff Im just going to connect this from point A to point B and just kind of talk a little bit about it but Ill probably end up deleting this and well change it for when we do actual Metro where well just reconfigure it next episode you know Metro you can take sharper turns no problem Im not looking to do the sharpest turn with this though and then Metro is basically like a lighter smaller version of a train and trains theyre big and heavy theyre still wonderful to go very fast but they take a while to get to speed so train stations especially you want to have your stations spread out Metro theyre not as big there I was heavy they still carry a lot of people though but because theyre lighter vehicles like the light rail hence that term right you can get some you know tighter turns more more stop frequency as you have a top that stops closer together because the vehicles wont take as long to to get to speed and then same kind of idea right if you want to have the stop space just far enough out that you wouldnt really walk it cuz I thought the point right you kind of take the metro do five or six blocks and then maybe theres a bus when you get out to help get you to your final destination so I went over to it Metro is very expensive you got to be going places where like we saw like theres high density theres so much demand right you wouldnt just put a metro for fun plus you know unless youre a baller right but what were hoping for now though right is the next round of people instead of them all queuing over here so the pathways have already been determined lets start watching the the crowd start to shuffle over in that direction and its exact same route you know so we should see this as the more efficient option because its faster and then to justify still having the bus we can add one more little stock or maybe change the route slightly but look how many people are going to be your new still get something over here which is good still makes it end up maybe those that live just a few extra blocks down here or like Im not walking the few extra blocks Ive already here these groceries are heavy were stopping and so in that sense its kind of good you know a cup spread the load right but over time this will decrease become more manageable and then this will be the preferred choice and because the capacity is so much greater on this there shouldnt be any issues at all but should we see the the people queuing right yeah we have empty platforms but look at the volume going in thats fantastic right and so that same thing could be done over with the trolley buses that first part where the mall is over there and see how were doing so the trolley buses yeah I probably didnt fix the problem I didnt think it would they look fantastic so I like using them but the trams trams do carry more people Im pretty sure the trolleys are a 30 as well yeah so its 30 and 30 so its the same as a regular bus and the trams would have a higher capacity but here you know here would be good spot for the M for the for the metro and were too hard for you today I hope that kind of makes sense though just a kind of way like everything ties together in capacity of vehicles routing you know the density you location to the city like what is the what is the purpose of the route all that kind of stuff you know it plays very heavily into it you might not think it does but it definitely does and we can see the cause and effect when you start linking up more zones of the city out of nowhere one small quadrant is this its so busy all these people here can suddenly like leave their car at home because the rest of the city is accessible to them and weve done that by connecting up a few different zones together you know suddenly John Paton Sally can all go meet in the middle right I never supposed to mean Bano here so now that Im back time has been been crunching this should be more more manageable right now where all the people go done and done we just shifted them to a more you know suitable means and we can free up bus traffic right but we use the alternate right we end up putting like 25 more buses that creates traffic thats counterproductive right so bike lanes walking buses Metro get your people out of the cars find a fun way to do it and theyll be forever grateful all right good I think thats it not a bad little start kind of went out a little bit there maybe rambling for some stuff I hope its helped a lot like buses are fantastic like dont ever stop using them its not like when the city gets big the buses go away you just might shift to bigger and better things but then like the Metro is only as strong as the routes that kind of support it if you live across the street youre going to use this Metro right theres no buses supporting it right so weve got to start pumping some more stuff through here trams and buses get the tram linked through here get people going right to justify this route add one maybe more stop right youll start seeing people use this bus again done and done maybe two more stops right so its an Express with four stops still Express cant stop everywhere anyway just use this accordingly and have some fun I think its the main thing make mistakes thats not the aim of the world and dont be afraid to change the budget sliders trial and error will get you there all right guys Ill see you again next episode well be focusing more on the trams in the metro and well probably do a followup episode after that with some trains and later on in the city maybe like five six seven episodes later from now were gonna revisit this but were going to have more of a cargo full focus so we talked about that cargo lines how do you get goods flowing instead of happy just like trucks on the highway and thatll be a lot of fun so yeah stay tuned alright guys things are taking out I will see you again drop me a comment like ask as many transit questions as you can I will do my best either incorporate them in the next video or just you know answer them we also have GBS our transit expert hes keeping an eye out in the chat so look out for him and yeah all the best guys if you found some Eureka moment share it with us wed love to hear that otherwise well see you again take care yourself happen building Music you Music;School Bus Route School Buses Trams Trolley Bus Depot

hi guys welcome back to my channel my name is elena and in this channel youll find lots of useful information on how to get a job at the bank the interview questions and answers um tips and tricks and how it is to work at the bank and just some general career advice so if youre interested in that please dont forget to subscribe alright guys so without further ado lets get right into the video so this video will be about my role as a personal banker slash banking advisor at the bank and what it was like so let me tell you guys briefly what is a personal banker if you dont already know so basically a personal banker or some banks may call it a banking advisor is an advisor exactly what it sounds like its basically like a finance advisor a person who gives you advice on your finances whether its investing applying for credit cards opening accounts so thats what a personal banker normally does and its basically the person you see in the bank offices so when you walk into the bank the first thing you would normally see is is all of the tellers and then you see like some offices there personal banker is the person who who sits inside the office and take customers inside to to have long discussions about their investments about their credit applications how to get approved for a credit card um general information about mortgages opening accounts for them and just like helping them with their finances in general usually when customers walk into the bank and go up to a teller and they they have a question regarding their investments or they want to invest the tellers will usually direct them to you they would send you a quick message and ask you to help the customer so um for this job you do have to be very confident and you have to be able to act like a professional because nobody wants to take financial advice and invest all of their money with somebody who doesnt look confident enough to be able to manage their money so the role of the personal banker is to make the customer feel comfortable and give them proper advice on investments and have to convince the customers to invest and sort of give them a call and follow up with them because you do have monthly targets so my manager would give me targets every month that i need to meet and those targets included like the volume the sales volume that i made so like how many customers invested how many approved credit card applications line of credits um so all of those things were measured um so it is a sales job you do get measured based on those targets which is something that a lot of people might not know or they might think that a personal banker doesnt have such high targets and that it wont be that hard but it could be difficult if if you dont really have past sales experience and you kind of dont know how to talk to clients or convince them to invest with you so that could be the challenge for some of the new hires and also at the beginning when you first start the job its kind of hard to get appointments because you do need appointments you do need to build lots of client relationships and have lots of appointments every day so that you could meet those targets but at the beginning what i felt like was very lost i didnt really know where to go how to get customers i was basically told to just make a bunch of cold calls and try to convince customers to invest and book appointments so i did have a hard time at the beginning however as you get the experience you start to find more customers because you see one customer and they start to trust you and then they always want to come to you or they recommend you to their family and friends and now you have like more customers just based off of one customer so guys thats what the job is basically like um and you do have to do like some complicated applications such as if a customer wants to apply for like a 50 000 line of credit you need to do the application and the application can be a long process it could take like two days you need to fill all of the customers information you need to ask the customer to bring you documents you need to follow up with those customers and this can be like a long process and if youre not very detail oriented its easy to make a mistake and if you make a mistake you will get chased once you send the application for approval they can send you lots of emails and you can get in trouble for making a mistake such as like inputting the wrong information or not providing the right documentations its also a job where you have to print lots of papers and get lots of client signatures and theres a lot of compliance like if you miss to get a signature like for example if you open an account for customer and you need to get their signature to open that account and you didnt get that signature they will send compliance department will send you lots of emails and you you will get chase to provide those signatures have a lot of coaching sessions with your manager if you forget to do certain things all right guys my mom just interrupted me again she always does she always interrupts me like in all my videos for some reason the moment i turn on the camera all of a sudden shes like oh i made you a milkshake and im like thats very nice but wrong time anyways guys so as i was saying um the job is not for everyone i would say that if youre a person who is really good with sales like youre just really good at selling things to people then this job might be good for you because its mostly all about targets and you get awards and good bonuses if youre meeting those targets so if youre good at that then i would suggest you to do the job but if you are not someone who would be good at sales and youre kind of shy and youre not like you dont think that you will be able to just have oneonone conversations with customers in an office and feel confident then i wouldnt do it sort of an independent job so as a teller you like talk a lot to your coworkers you meet with like 300 customers every day but as a personal banker you basically sit inside an office from nine to five and you see maybe like 10 to 15 customers based on the appointments and you have long discussions with those customers so um its not a job where you interact a lot with people although it looks like a job where you interact a lot but it was a huge transition for me to go from a teller to a personal banker because i didnt get to talk to my coworkers a lot i only saw a few customers and for me personally i like to always interact with people otherwise the job seems boring so that was one thing i didnt like but thats all guys i think ive covered everything that you do as a personal banker if i did miss something please dont hesitate to comment down below and ask me questions and ill answer them thank you for watching;Intro What is a Personal Banker Conclusion;2
hi how are you hope youve had a really nice week i dont know where you are but here in houston it is bitterly cold it must be i dont know 35 degrees outside overcast we had snow and sleet in the area which is so unhouston let me tell you it also has me wishing and longing for warmer temperatures and the sunshine to come out which really inspired my tutorial idea for this week and i mentioned last week that i had something new and different for you and i think it is and im going to step back and show you what it is im not seated today im actually standing in the bathroom and the reason for that is what im about to present is going to require some demonstrations so here we go in light of the fact that spring and summer are around the corner and that im just itching to break out this type of attire one of my personal favorite things to wear is a scarf i adore scarves i love the class i love the versatility i think theyre elegant there are so many ways to wear a scarf and ive noticed that when i do sometimes ill have women come up to me and theyll say hey i never thought to do that or where did you come up with that idea which led to todays tutorial i want to show you 10 different ways to wear a scarf during our spring and summer months this is i would say a medium sized scarf it measures 34 by 34 inches so i would recommend a medium size to be able to achieve all of these some of them are a little shorter and you may run into some problems and then some are very long you can wrap and make into skirts and dresses but you wont be able to achieve some of the looks im going for so again a medium sized scarf 10 different ways to wear it are you ready okay lets go first of all here in texas we love a western look so one of my favorite ways and ill do this on air sometimes is you take your scarf into a triangle you may need to fold it over a few times just so its not so big and you take it and you wrap it around your neck and then bring it back around like so and you tie it up front makes nice like a nice high collar this is perfect by the way if youre wearing a blazer i love that especially with a crisp white shirt and you take it and you tuck it into your shirt and then youve got this wonderful pop of color inside your shirt with a blazer on top in fact i think i even demonstrated this in my several ways to wear a suit video so again this is a really classic sort of a ralph lauren look its one of my favorites i do it all the time the next thing is very very simple and you can do this practically id say over anything and its just a very loose fitting shawl so you take your scarf you put it in a large triangle you just drape it over your shoulders you tie it very loosely on the ends a little knot and you can either wear it like so just loosely hanging this way or twist it to the side so that youve got your knot on one shoulder pull it down a little bit and this is a beautiful look over a sundress as well and just to keep the shoulders warm so a really nice shawl speaking of keeping you warm lets say youre wearing something light during the day and you transition to evening and youre outside this is this can actually be a great jacket and heres what you do you go corner to corner so im going to take these two on one side and im going to tie them in a little tiny knot right here okay and then im going to do the same on the other side corner to corner same side youre not going on the diagonal okay so now you basically have are you ready for this you have made your own jacket out of your scarf hangs perfectly over the shoulders and look how decorative that is is that not super cool so again i mean you can literally tuck this in your purse pull it out at night if you dont want to carry a big jacket but you want to cut the wind or just you know that little bit of a chill this is a great way to do it so again your scarf becomes a jacket another thing that you can do and again this looks really nice with a high collared shirt is we will make this into a choker so im going to take it and do the diagonal like so and then im going to go again so im making a smaller triangle and im going to fold it because i like the color to show youve noticed the white is on the outside the color in the middle so im now going to fold it in and im going to make a band id say about two inches in diameter keep going so now it looks like this and then what you can do is you can take it and you can knot this in the middle so just tie it in a knot which gives kind of an interesting piece and then once youve done that you take this and youve created a choker necklace and then you tie it in the back behind your neck and again its a wonderful decorative piece to bring some color and it makes it makes a necklace so ill step in and you can see a little bit better but in that pretty so you have the knot in the middle which makes it interesting and again youve created a beautiful necklace out of a scarf all right let me step back and lets see easy peasy okay so lets go back to our triangle the big one fold it in half you have a big triangle again im going to start folding it from the outside in because i like to see a lot of the color so im going to take our little corner here again about a 2 inch diameter keep folding and folding and rolling until you get a very long thin scarf take that around your neck like so and you can either tie it in a very loose knot like that and let it hang you can double tie it you can just leave it like that inside a blazer but again this adds a really nice pop of color if you dont want something high on the neck this is just a very loose decorative way to wear a scarf okay oh and now that its like this by the way lets say um you dont have a belt or its not the right color or you want something thats a little bit more colorful and interesting this becomes a belt so im going to step back you take it and you just string it through your belt loops ill probably skip some belt loops here just to save some time okay and if you want you can sash do a little tie to the side as opposed to in the middle i like the side tie a little bit better but there you go you have now made a belt out of your scarf and i think thats just a very fun little sassy way to do it okay so youve got a purse and lets say youre wearing a very light flowy sundress or whatever and you just sort of want to keep that flow going take your scarf fold it up just the way we did but kind of loosen it up a little bit and then take a handle and then tie it around a handle on your purse so just a very loose tie and voila you have added a very pretty piece to your handbag and again kind of a preppy western traditional look um i love this bag this bag looks like a very expensive handbag you know which one im thinking about but its a saint nicola bag that i found here in houston and the price point was terrific so i think this just looks really regal and nice and i didnt have to break the bank for it okay moving on um oh yeah this is fun too i love wearing hats im a huge huge hat fan and so during the summer time i will do kind of a straw fedora but lets just say im not really into the band around the hat or i want ive got maybe an orange bathing suit and i want to tie in that color i will then take my scarf and i will tie it around the hat so you just go like so see im going to set it down so i can tie it and cover the black perfect and again this is very fun and decorative and now you have your scarf around your hat pretty snazzy uh you can also make a hat out of your scarf by the way this is great if youre in a car and the windows are down and you dont want your hair blowing in your face or youre on a boat or whatever the case may be and sometimes hats will blow off just take your scarf and the long triangle go like so over your head totally mess up my hair but whatever for the purpose of the video it must be done and then im going to tie this behind all right there we go so this is kind of a hippie boho look going oh my gosh the hair scary whatever and then i absolutely love popping on some really cool shades with this these have a bit of a gold tint to them so anyway very very fun this is a really good beachy look and again it keeps the hair out of your face and last but not least you can make a top out of this so you have your big triangle two ends take it wrap it around your back bring it up youve got your two ends here you can crisscross and you can make it a halter top you will need by the way a bigger scarf thats a little risque but you can do this with a larger scarf by the way i do it all the time and and its a really really cool look but again you do a little halter in the back crisscross it around the front and youve made a little top thats a little scary lets see if i go like this oh yeah heres another way to do it with this size scarf just take it across the back and tie it here im preferring this with this scarf i really dont want you to be trashy so just just ignore the last demonstration not with this scarf with something bigger please im all about class there we go thats better so this is now a cute little halter top it ties in the back everything is covered accentuates the waist and im feeling much better about this look okay 10 ways to wear a scarf i hope it inspired you i hope it got you excited for summertime and spring and you know most women do have at least one scarf in their closet im assuming that you do if not go out and treat yourself to a beautiful scar find some colors that really make you happy and that go with the things that you have in your closet and just enjoy play around with it use your creativity and have fun because in the end isnt that what its all about okay comments and suggestions below i have so many

hi Im dr Mary Gartner one of the most common questions US hospice veterinarians get from families is when will I know its time to say goodbye to my pet and assessing quality of life and in picking that time is very difficult for not only us veterinarians but also you know that the families and so I want to talk about some some things that can help guide you as you make these decisions but first I actually want to start with a patient of ours this is Duncan Duncan is a hundred and ten pound red Doberman he was adopted by his family when he was older when he was six years old and at the time of us seeing him he was about twelve and a half now Duncan his his personality was just you know protector of the family but just full force life and theres some things that made Duncan Duncan and thats the way he loved to hunt moles preferred salmon flavored treats he loved his orthopedic beds his long walks and and hugging people with his long neck and some treats of course now Duncan had not many medical problems but one thing that was unique to him was that he was an aggressive drinker so he drank like a water buffalo he stick his nose in the in though in the water and just suck it all up so thats important as I continue this story but another note is that he had adoring mom and dad who loved Duncan and would do anything for him now at about ten years old he started to have a little bit of a clearing of his throat episode so well his parents then decided to bring him to the cardiologist just to make sure that his heart was okay because Dobermans they commonly get heart disease and so any coughing dog thats one of the things that we worry about well actually he was diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis and thats just a disease of the nerves of the larynx and so it thats why it caused that little tickle and one of the ways to to treat it is actually to do surgery and so the owners were concerned about surgery because of his drinking habits one of the side effects of that surgery is what we call aspiration pneumonia and so as hes drinking maybe things will go into lungs versus his esophagus however the owners really wanted to do the surgery because they knew his life would would end shorter if if he was left the way that he was so they they did the surgery and almost everything went well although he did vomit because of this sedation and anesthesia so he did have a little aspiration pneumonia post surgery and heres a picture of Duncan with his with his I call it the the the air the air snorkels but he recovered well with no other problems and the owners are thrilled and he went back to his mole hunting life and hugging people and just enjoying life as a senior so all was good for about two years except for the owner started noticing him dragging his feet a little bit and so in the sand where they would walk they start to see just a little toe drag or on the on the pavement they would hear his toes dragging and although he had good muscle tone they just noticed every now and then that he would start to sink a little bit and so now you know hes about 12 years old that by this time and they they added on some some medications for his for his mobility issues and so at a hundred and ten pounds you can imagine that thats a lot of medications for them to give Duncan however they were dedicated to his to his condition and making sure that he had he had the best one of the things that we commonly recommend with Lorenzo paralysis his acupuncture and Duncan actually was a very good patient for his acupuncturist and tolerated treatment really well however a couple of months after they started noticing this mobility issue he started having some some respiratory increased effort and increased coughing and just some less energy that wasnt normal for Duncan so thats when they you know called their hospice veterinarian and you know we work together to work out some of the concerns that wed have first of course is that aspiration pneumonia which is a common problem with Loranger paralysis maybe there was a failure of the surgery site so even though had been maybe two years since his surgery we wanted to make sure that that wasnt an possibility again any coughing dog we always worry about heart problems particularly with Dobermans or maybe there was just something new that was going on that is just adding on to his to his problems well at the cardiologist he was diagnosed with DCM which is dilated cardiomyopathy he also had arrhythmias some thickened valves so his heart was not well on top of his mobility meds we needed to add some meds for his heart as well now the concerns at this point were that Duncan may actually have an arrhythmia and have sudden death and you know I had to talk to the owners to say thats thats something that could happen where he dies on his own and its not painful but you may not be present and and just wrapping our minds around that was something that I had to help the families with the other is when the heart isnt well we could it could lead to heart failure and thats thats actually fluid buildup in the lungs and that could lead to respiratory distress and the owners did not want that because thats thats anxiety and its its a form of suffering that we definitely did not want for Duncan but we monitored hurt him and made sure he was taking his drugs well and and enjoying his life except for as the as the weeks went on his appetite started wavering his energy kept decreasing now he he was starting to get some diarrhea and then he didnt want to take those pills anymore and those were a lot of pills and then he was peeing and drinking a lot so when youre on some of those heart meds your pet will drink drink drink drink drink and then pee pee pee and at 110 pounds that was a lot of urine to come home to so we started to making the you know to think about making the decisions for for when to say goodbye now some concerns are that mom and dad didnt totally believe the same the same right they werent on the same page and thats so common alright theres theres always a family member that may want to keep on going or one family member is done and they want to say goodbye so theres rarely a time where everybodys in agreement so if thats your family youre not alone now another problem with this particular case is mom traveled a lot so most of the caregiving fell on dad so all those pills all that drinking and pain and Mickey dreams going to his cardiologist appointment that was dad responsibility and it could it could get difficult now thinking about when is time again that the family wasnt always on the same page now mom wanted to make sure that she tried everything all that the best drugs the best specialist the acupuncturist but she knew she would not let her boy go into respiratory distress or heart failure now dad dad wanted his boy to go like a warrior now what does that mean so for dad that meant you know he wanted his boy to still be running around chasing moles loving on people still having an appetite not having diarrhea he just wanted what what Duncans essence was to still be there when he said goodbye now Ill get back to Duncan and and and what happened with him but I want to now focus on this question that we get so often doc when will I know his time and if youre having this question and asking your veterinarian I hope I can give you some some tips when Im asked about when is time I have to put I have to look at different categories one is the ailment that the pet has is it a mobility issue is it is it a heart issue is that another organ failure is it their mind and cognition and so I want to talk to the owners about how that ailment is going to progress over time and how they may pass from that naturally or when it comes time to make a decision the next category Im gonna look at is the pets personality how well do they handle all the medications we have to give how well do they handle being left at home for 4 hours at a time you know how well do they handle maybe other pets in the house and and them having struggles trying to get out the door when the younger pet crashes through the door and pushes them out of their way so I want to take into consideration their personality and what makes them the warrior the next category I have to look at is the personal beliefs of the family and like I said earlier not everybodys going to agree with when is time or when do we want to keep on going and so that can be one of the most challenging parts of all this the next category are the budgets and I want to focus a little bit on the budgets whats the quality of life not only for the pet but also the family and thats where the budgets come into play first off theres the financial budget of taking care of your pet its not easy you know theres theres some medications theres maybe some pet sitters or pet walkers that you have to afford depending on the size your pet those medications may be more expensive if you have a hundred and ten pound Doberman versus a 10 pound Chihuahua so thats something to you know to understand it that we have to all struggle with the next budget is time do you have enough time to care for your pet and thats hard Duncan he had to be let out every four hours because he would if not pee in the house and that was hard for the family you know who here has a job where they could go and come back every four hours luckily for Duncan his dad worked from home but time is always so precious and sometimes we dont have enough of it to take care of ourselves let alone a geriatric or terminally ill pet or maybe we have to travel for work or travel just with our family and who best to take care of our loved ones but ourselves and so that sometimes starts to change what we do on vacations or work the next budget is the physical budget can you physically handle your pet in the ailments that that theyre struggling with so for Duncan he had mobility issues well hes 110 pounds and so to lift him could become very difficult but even a small dog is not always easy to manage or a cat picking them up to give them their drugs or their medications can be a challenge the last budget is the emotional budget are you emotionally able to handle everything thats going on whether its deciding when to say goodbye bringing them to the to the doctor seeing them not themselves and so that emotional budget and that emotional category is one that we all forget about but weighs heavily on us as a hospice veterinarian I know that if any one of these budgets done I support the decision of the family to say goodbye so if they financially cant manage or cant afford the treatment thats best for their pet its okay and Ill help them say goodbye if they dont have enough time to properly care for their pet Ill help them say goodbye if they physically cant help pick up that dog or pick up that kitty cat then Ill help them say goodbye and if theyre emotionally ready Ill definitely help them say goodbye now remember one of the categories that I talked about which is the pets ailment when Im helping a family I want to I want to consider how the pets disease process is going to is going to present itself towards the end and so most of us or a lot of people say I want my pet to die in their sleep to die in their bed and we want that so we dont have to make that decision and trust me I understand and I myself I hope I pass at home in my bed but thats not always the case and sometimes we as pet parents we have to make the decision to intervene so that way our pets dont suffer so when Im helping an owner and Im talking about the disease they they have I want to talk about how how they will passed from that disease and how quickly we need to make that decision now how quickly we need to call and make an appointment for for a euthanasia and so if we have an imminent disease that means we dont have a lot of time to plan and so this is usually diseases that affect breathing so anything that that puts our pet in respiratory distress so for example heart failure like Duncan or laryngeal paralysis like Duncan before his surgery maybe a spread of cancer to the lungs or collapsing trachea all these diseases affect breathing and when you cant breathe thats the worst feeling and so unfortunately that one that when we get to that point things things go go really go really south fast now on the other end we have non emit diseases where the elements of those diseases take a very long time to cause a really bad issue so for instance kidney failure and many cats have kidney failure and they could live for years with with very minimal ailment from it or symptoms from it and so maybe a little in a patent maybe a little vomiting here and there but theyve probably done that their entire life and so we are we are left with a lot more time to make that decision another non imminent disease that we see so often is is like dementia but in dogs and cats and so they may they may act Spacey or not really coherent all the time so this is not necessarily a sufferable disease and so we may be we may be gifted with a lot more time with them before they they really start to suffer and somewhere in between are some of the diseases that you know what we we dont have a lot of time but its not an emergent situation when that time comes so I want to help families pick the best time and its not always knowing when the best time is but also the best experience and so if we need to euthanize our pets if we need to be the ones that make that decision what do you want the experience to be do you want to have maybe an intimate setting with just a few family members or do you want to have almost a party to wish your best friend goodbye with all the people that they love surrounding them and so if we want to plan that event sometimes we have to think about the disease they have to make sure that we have enough time to plan such an event now when I talk to owners about when is time I kind of break it into three categories first is quality of life is good for the pet and for the parent now they may be struggling with some mobility issues or crying at night or something like that but but for the most part their quality of life is good and the family is okay and all the other budgets so theyre able to handle that pet well on the complete other side I see act of suffering happening and thats what we want to avoid that and these are sometimes the worst euthanasia is because everybodys anxious the pets anxious the familys anxious the veterinarians are anxious we want the very best but when when the bodys shutting down and and suffering is occurring things dont always go as well as we had hoped now in between is a very large area and this is the subjective time period I call this the rollercoaster and so you might have good days and bad days and you just rollercoaster through the weeks and months and some days you may say you know what we had a really bad weekend and and now its time but then Tuesday pops and hes fine and so then you then you say no no I dont want to do it so this subjective time period is its hard to be in but this is actually where most of you are finding yourself and thats why I wanted to do this to help you you know guide yourself along that path now anytime a pet is in this subjective time period its okay to say goodbye and so where I would euthanize my pet or your neighbor or your friend or another family member you know its irrelevant its its whats best for you and your family and so at anytime if your pet is in that subjective time period whether theyre closer to all is good or even touching the the act of suffering I support your decision to say goodbye so if you had that really bad weekend and Tuesday hes doing better but you know what you dont want another bad weekend Ill help you say goodbye now theres a couple of symptoms that hospice veterinarians deal with a lot and these symptoms can change quality of life quite drastically so mobility for a dog you know we think about our dog so it makes them happy and going for walks and run around the yard and chasing a tennis ball or something like that and so mobility for dogs is very important cats not so much you know they they they do get arthritis and some mobility issues but for cats laying on the couch or laying in a sunbeam is so important to them so some other symptoms that we help manage those hydration appetite we do see the changes of appetite as we get older hygiene are they able to stay clean are they urinating on themselves or theyre not able to groom themselves if theyre a cat happiness is important and sometimes thats hard to decide when is your pet when is your pet happy and and this is where I fall on the owners the most is to help understand what what makes that pet them what makes Duncan Duncan what makes you know the cat love the Sunbeam where some loves to just you know be a part of of the family you know events so happiness is a very unique symptom lets say to each pet and each family and the last symptom that we have to manage very carefully is pain and so almost everybody is going to say I dont want my pet to be in pain I dont want them to suffer and I completely agree except for sometimes we dont always know whats going on with our pets and I dont want to say they hide their pain but you know they just deal with it differently most dogs and cats just dont complain I can get an infected hangnail and Im you know shut down for the whole weekend where a pet could be limping along with the worst arthritis but still wagging their tail and so deciding when this time based on pain can be tricky because we dont always know how to read our pets and so I like to divide pain into three different kinds of categories or types of pain first is the pain that we all recognize like arthritis right so we all know about that kind of pain or can imagine what that feels like and so thats a type of pain that that we see often especially in larger breed dogs another type of pain is disease or malaise just feeling achy this is usually the cats with endstage kidney failure or endstage lymphoma and so just having that malaise and ickiness is is a form of pain the last type of pain is anxiety or distress and so maybe dogs with cognitive dysfunction and theyre anxious when their owners leave and or when thunderstorms are you know what they used to be upset about thunderstorms now as an everyday occurrence or any of those respiratory distress symptoms thats another type of pain and so I want you to think about that that it may not be obvious to you with the limping dog but maybe if theyre just not feeling good or theyre not thats why theyre not eating or theyre vomiting or theyre so distressed all day long thats not a good quality of life now a lot of people will think dont worry youll know when is time and I avoid that because we dont always know when is time and especially when its you and your own pet its hard to understand all these signs of pain or disease or malaise or anxiety you know what we we dont want to say goodbye and so sometimes its difficult to assess that now some people say dont worry theyll give you a look well theres not always a look and trust me if youve got if youve got a Labrador thats got mobility issues Labradors just never have a bad day theyve got a joy gene that I wish I could tap into sometimes but they dont always give you a look alright so dont dont always think that thats something that youre going to see now heres my own cat Herbie and Herbie had a primary lung tumor which affected his his breathing and as you know I dont like that and if you see that one picture where hes laying on my chest and I look at his face and I think thats thats a look and so what I realized though is that if Im waiting for for a pet to give me a look Im waiting for like what Herbie did and Herbie was suffering and even as a educated veterinarian I know its so difficult to say goodbye that I think I waited too long for Herbie and and and I was waiting for a look and that that means Im waiting for a look of suffering and so I want you to avoid suffering in your pet and so maybe its not cut and dry to just look for a look now evaluating quality of life can be a challenge but theres different ways that we could monitor our quality of life and so I want to go over some some common common ways that you may here first is finding their top five favorite things to do and maybe thats going for a walk sitting with you watching TV eating I dont know having friends come over whatever that may be whatever makes your pet your pet figure out those top five favorite things and when theyre not doing three of them consistently maybe its maybe its a time to intervene but I want you to be careful because some of the diseases your pet may have they will still be doing these five favorite things even though theyre actively struggling throughout the day so I see this a lot with cognitive dysfunction so they may still be eating and wanting to go for a walk and doing those things that youve categorized but 90 percent of their day their just standing still staring into a corner so you have to be careful about these five favorite things and making sure youre thinking about the disease they have and well that disease effect these five favorite things I also like to add instead of five favorite things do four favorite things but add something that they hate that theyre passionate about so for Duncan he was passionate about protecting his family from the Goodyear blimp that flew over the house at 1000 and for every day and so when that motor started to be heard he would get all worked up and start to yell at that Goodyear blimp or bark at the Goodyear blimp to let him know that hes in his airspace and so I told you you know dad that you know what if he stops caring about that Goodyear blimp it just doesnt care maybe thats where hes hes not feeling so well and he cant you know his heart Maebys is giving up so much energy that he cant expend the energy on telling the Goodyear blimp to go away so add something they hate to the five now on the theme of five theres a wonderful website the ASPCA pro org and they talk about the five freedoms so I encourage you to go to this website and learn more about these five freedoms now one of the most common things I hear someone say is you know what when hes had more bad days than good and I know when is time but you know if you dont measure what youre monitoring its very difficult to decide is it more is it more good days than bad days and so one easy way to do this is and this is very good with children is get to jars and put the words good on one and bad on another and have as a family a decision of was today good or bad and then put a penny in one of those jars and at the end of the month or two months what what jar is more full and so thats one easy way to monitor another is simply getting a calendar out and putting it somewhere where everybody can see so on the refrigerator and putting a big red X on the on the bad days but you have to decide as a family what is it bad day is it not sleeping through the night is it not eating well is it howling whatever it may be that that is a bad day for your pet with their with their ailment and their personality that is something you have to decide first and then you want to check off or put big red Xs on those bad days heres an example calendar and if you just look at it quickly its almost equal right so its just as many good days as bad days and so maybe its time to to say goodbye in this pets case another thing that a calendar will allow you to do is look for trends so look at Friday whats going on and in this case it was the garbage truck that always came and it worked up the dog into such a panic that the rest of his day was just downhill and so maybe you actually can do some some home adjustments to make them better theres an app that weve created at lappa love called gray muzzle and its free for you and you can download it on your on your iPhone or your Android and what it will do is itll allow you to create a profile for your pet and then every day you could say if its a good day bad day or just kind of an okay neutral day and then theres some calendars or some graphs that you can visually look to see how how your pet is is progressing theres also some qualityoflife scales and Diaries that we have available on our website and theres some categories that we want you to focus on like mobility or appetite and youre going to give it a score of like zero one or two and then youre going to add up all of those categories and then theres a chart to go off of to see if if your quality life is okay or if interventionists is best this is an example of a friend of mine in Canada shes a hospice veterinarian and on her scale she adds if the pet is giving love or taking love and this comes to their personality because sometimes maybe theres a cat that never get never gave love and so this wouldnt you know be a good way to judge that cats a progression but maybe maybe for your pet actually knowing if theyre if theyre loving on you or wanting you to pet them thats a good indication of quality of life this is a family who had gotten gigantic postie notes and they put it on the wall and this is for their golden retriever bogey and every day somebody from the family would write how well he slept if he took his medications if he ate did he have diarrhea and just his general attitude and similar to labs golden czar pretty happy dogs and so they wanted to monitor how his happiness and how he was doing and so this was really great because it was such a big poster in the middle of the living room that everybody can see and thats what I want you to do is have everybody involved and everybodys seen whats going on because if youre the primary caregiver and nobody understands that the struggles that you are facing every day then when it comes time to make that decision they may not be in agreement with you so get the whole family involved we also have a tool called the Pet hospice journal and what this allows you to do is create a profile for your pet and youre gonna pick the disease that your pet is struggling with and based on that disease were going to monitor the different symptoms that that happen because of this disease so for instance if your dog has mobility issues we know theyre probably still gonna have an appetite so we really want to focus on the things they struggle with with mobility issues and so the Pet hospice journal is a little bit more advanced than the grey muzzle app but it may be a really good tool for your family now one of the things I love about that Pet hospice journal is it allows you to post pictures or attach pictures every day and looking at pictures is so important because how your pet looked maybe just even a year ago could be very different than how they look now and so every day is you see your pet every day you dont always notice the changes as theyre occurring and so just looking back and and seeing how they looked when they were healthier may give you clarity on how they look now and so I really love and encourage you to go look at pictures of your pet another thing that I adore are bucket lists so these are a list of all the favorite things that your pet enjoys that you want to make sure they do before you say goodbye and heres Eddies bucket list and theres things on here like you know going to the park and having a steak dinner even attending a birthday party and not inviting Emily for some reason and I love Eddies bonus which is writing in a firetruck and so they were able to check off everything that they did for Eddie before they had to say goodbye and I tell you when when the day came for them to say goodbye to Eddie they had no rats because they did everything on his bucket list so think about your pet and their personality and what whats important to them now and make that list and check off all those favourite things theres a place called denial island and Ive been there myself with my own pets and its just really hard when youre when youre dealing dealing with these things yourself when its your pet and you dont want to say goodbye that we could maybe let things go a little bit too long and and I understand now a smaller version would just be denial goggles and this is Darby Darby was a patient of mine many years ago and Darbys mom was the one who told me about denial denial Island and so she did some quality of life scales but she kept giving Darby excellent and everything is fine but she knew to her be was not well so she asked me if I would do the quality of life scale for her because she was on denial island and maybe that would be helpful to you is getting advice from from friends or family that know you that know your pet better than then maybe you do at this time because youve got those denial goggles on and they can help you now going back to Duncan and is it time for him and so I want you to think about everything that that that we learned about the budgets of the family and his personality and the ailment that hes got with that heart failure and how his how his disease is gonna progress and and how how his goodbyes will be so Duncans family had a previous experience with their last Doberman Neos so they loved Dobermans now neo had cancer and his medications were making him drink a lot and pee a lot and so they had to when they left for the day had to had a blockade um in in a hallway well unfortunately they came home one afternoon and neo had passed on his own and although like I mentioned earlier many of us want our pets to die on their own they actually werent ready for that especially in the middle of the day and they didnt get to say goodbye they didnt get to say I love you and so when they came home and neo was already gone it was very traumatic for them and they knew they didnt wanted to not be present again and so they thought about that when when evaluating quality of life was was happening with Duncan so now with his mobility issues and his heart issues his pharmacy got to be a little bit a little bit big and so he had to take many pills multiple times a day and the family is willing to do that they would have done anything for Duncan but Duncan started to not want to take his pills now one day when mom was traveling Duncans dad sent her a text message and it said Duncan is not eaten in a day and a half now and Im really tired of trying to figure out what to do cat food meat cubes pill pockets Ive killed him the last nine times and now today it looks like Ill have to do it all again so I want you to think about the budgets what budget is is about for dad and that would be the emotional budget he cant handle this anymore his dog his Duncan is not the warrior that he that he was and so dad is ready to say goodbye the problem was is that Duncans mom was me and I wanted to make sure that I did everything I could as a veterinarian but you know what Im still a mom and I wanted to also make sure that his quality of life was good and that I dont I dont keep holding on just for my own reasons and so you know what I agreed with dad is that I wanted him to go like a warrior too and so I wanted to make sure that I was home and present and did his bucket list so we made a bucket list for Duncan and whats important to him and it was everything from a slumber party to an inandout party visits from his human girlfriends and even one last pee on the neighbors plants and maybe a chase into the mail truck and it was was not his normal chase into the mail truck but a few good barks he got in and so I made sure that we did everything on his bucket list its that way when it came time to say goodbye I would still have grief but I would not have regret and so a year ago I had to say see you later to my boy and you know I tell you this story because I want you to know that youre not alone in this difficult decision youre not alone on denial Island you have a support system here at lap of love our veterinarians will help you with assessing quality of life and guiding you through this important time and important decisions well I hope this gave you some information and tips on on how to best assess quality of life for your pet in your family and I hope it is going to help you in in deciding when is time to say goodbye and if we can say goodbye surrounded by friends and family and give your pet the love that they deserve then even though it will still be sad youll know that youve made the best decision;Duncan Duncan Doodle Noodle

so you just bought a brand new laptop and youre wondering what are some of the things that you could do to make sure that it runs at its best setting but most importantly fits your preference now ive been following a checklist of items every time when i get a laptop here in the studio so i thought it would be cool to share some of the things that um i do with you guys now some of the things that i mentioned may sound familiar to our hardcore audience but i want to create this guide for those who are beginning to get used to a windows laptop so without any further ado lets get started the very first thing that i tackle is checking to see if there are any updates to windows now since most laptops ship with windows 11 these days it is important to make sure if there are any security patches or essential driver updates so that your laptop would run at its best setting i actually did a separate video covering the performance difference between the earlier versions of windows 11 and the latest build and the results were really really interesting so you can check that out right over here if youre interested to do this all you have to do is click on the start button search up updates and a popup window will show up letting you know what needs to be downloaded i should also mention that you will need to be connected to an internet connection for this to happen um as you can see i do have quite a few updates for this dell xps 15 so im gonna download them which may require a few reboots and well take it from there i should also mention that windows 11 has slowly started taking over updates that oem manufacturers handle for example a few years ago you would have a separate utility software provided by the laptop manufacturer to check new bioss or firmware updates for the hardware but thats not the case anymore because windows 11 has just taken that matter into its own hands and whether you like it or not its coming to you personally im not a huge fan of this change because i like having that control over what manufacturers offer but yeah let me know what you guys think about that in the comments the second step is to get rid of all the bloatware apps installed on your pc most laptop manufacturers peel their devices with trial versions of mcafee antivirus or norton or it could be something else like amazon alexa thats installed on this xbox 15 which i dont really need i mean its just useless so these applications can take up valuable system resources which would affect performance ive actually done a separate video going over this and the results are truly eye opening and look im not saying that you shouldnt be running antivirus its just that there are better applications out there compared to what comes standard on these laptops another side tip while were at this is that you can actually disable certain startup applications that dont matter to you when you boot up your pc this can actually help speed up boot up times to do this you can hit up start or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl alt delete and navigate to task manager then under the startup tab you can start and select and disable the apps to your preference the nzxt capsule microphone get the best airflow for your vocal experience with a modular popout chamber to simplify installation on and off the base control the gain for best volume rpm in a package that looks this good with usbc and headphone input io with a true unbox plugandplay solution for your loud thoughts to shine the capsule sounds pretty neutral as you can hear plus its a good place to start if you plan to overclock with eq later check out the nzxt capsule black or white down below the next thing to do is optimizing your display settings and this mostly has to do with resolution scaling you see most laptops come with the display scale to 125 including 1080p panels now this isnt a terrible setting since people who struggle to look at icons might find this comforting but if you want more screen real estate scaling it back to 100 can give you more room for applications to do this all you have to do is right click on the desktop home screen click on display settings and then navigate to scale under scale and layout options and choose a hundred percent now if your laptop comes with a qhd or 4k display you might have to play around with that percentage value to ensure youre comfortably able to see icons and text while having more room for applications for example 4k on a 13 inch laptop at 100 is literally impossible to read youll essentially in a microscope for that this razer blade pro 17 for instance comes with a 17 inch quad hd display and scaled to 150 by default out of the box which as you can see wastes so much space so dialing it back to 100 makes a world of a difference a side tip that goes along with this step to help you with your productivity is to take advantage of windows virtual desktops its essentially a feature for laptops or anyone using a single monitor where if they find the applications to be taken up too much space or feel like theyre cluttered this is where you can sort of offset and organize them all you have to do is use your four fingers to swipe up using the trackpad and then select one of the apps and then drag it to the bottom where it says new desktop and just like that youll have both applications running separately and you can switch between them by swiping left or right with your four fingers its a great way to avoid cluttering the next step is to know how to use a mug switch if your laptop has one for starters mux stands for multiplexer and its a switch that lets you disable the integrated graphics that comes with your cpu and runs the display off of the discrete gpu by default most gaming laptops with a dedicated graphics card have either nvidia advanced optimus or amd smart shifts if you have an ultrabook or a thin and light device without a discrete gpu this step is essentially not even necessary a good example of a laptop with a discrete gpu is when youre casually browsing the web or doing general tasks the system uses the integrated graphics to preserve battery life whereas if you switch to something thats gpu accelerated like gaming or any sort of creative work the system utilizes the more powerful discrete gpu the only problem with optimus is that it could result in latency since the frames or data thats being pushed out from the discrete gpu goes through the integrated graphics chip before reaching the display and that could cause a bottleneck affecting frame rates in games so thats where a muk switch comes into the equation because it allows the user to run the display directly off of the discrete graphics card by eliminating those latencies to enable this varies from one laptop manufacturer to another for instance legion uses hybrid mode through vantage software razer has a specific option in the gpu mode through synapse alienware has hybrid mode that can be accessed through the bios asus can be done through armory crate its all over the place so you just have to look through the primary utility software that comes with your laptop the only downside which i think is a pretty big deal is enabling mux with just the discrete graphics will significantly affect battery life uh if youre plugged in sure its not a big deal but make sure you disable it when you go on battery mode it would require system reboot so keep that in mind the next thing i do is disable the windows lock screen with the time and date prompt now this is the first thing that shows up on screen and when you boot up the laptop it comes with a nice wallpaper and some codes if you have a password setup which you should you either have to press the enter key or the space key to get to the password prompt screen now disabling the lock screen lets you jump right into the prompt section without having to press any keys so all you have to do is enter your password and youre off to the races it saves a little bit of time to do this hit up start type in gpedit and then under computer configuration navigate to administrative templates then control panel and then personalization and double click on do not display the lock screen click on enabled click apply and thats it now as im making this video gpe or group policy editor is only available on windows 11 pro if youre using home you might need to do a few registry tweaks but thats not officially supported by microsoft so keep that in mind next up i enable file extensions since i work with a lot of png jpeg psd and a lot of music formats so knowing the type of file is crucial for my workflow and im sure itll help you guys as well to do this open file manager click on the three dots that bring up the popup menu click on options navigate to view and then uncheck the option that says hide extensions for known file types and click apply as you can see the pictures and music formats show their types this feature actually helps me a lot with my organization the last few touches are pretty straightforward i just go ahead and install all my commonly used applications like the creative suite from adobe davinci resolve studio spotify whatsapp and a bunch of other apps i also enabled dark mode which is something that im fond of and i also start browsing for wallpapers now i use wallhaven which is my primary source for all the wallpapers that you guys have been asking for so there you have it oh and the last thing that i do is set up desktop icons because i need quick access to my computer and if i need to go into settings its just right there so in order to do that i just right click click personalize and then head over to themes and then click on i just scroll all the way down to desktop icon settings and then i check mark computer user files network control panel hit apply and as you can see those are all right over there so yeah that pretty much wraps up things that you need to do when youre setting up a laptop i might have missed a few things that maybe you guys might do when you set up your own laptop so feel free to chime in the comments down below if theres anything that i missed but yeah these are some of the things that i do when i get a new laptop here in the studio so i hope you guys enjoyed this one thank you so much for watching and ill talk to you guys in the next one;This

hey everyone i hope youre all doing well today im going to be talking about all things mechanical engineering im going to break down what the field is some of its history and definitions then ill look into the things you might learn if you decide to take mechanical engineering as your engineering degree after that ill be talking about what you can expect your starting salary to be and what companies you could work for and finally ill talk about a masters in mechanical engineering if its worth it and how it differs from an undergrad if youre looking forward to learning a lot about mechanical engineering today then leave a like on the video and subscribe to the channel and lets get it started so what is mechanical engineering well according to the wikipedia page mechanical engineering combines engineering physics mathematics and material science to design analyze manufacture and maintain mechanical systems and its one of the oldest and broadest branches of engineering just like mechanical engineering itself this definition is pretty broad and it doesnt really tell you all that much and the main reason for this is that a mechanical system is pretty much anything that moves some examples might be gears chains belts bearings fluid heat and even air pretty much everything moves in some way and mechanical engineers will either design things to make it move or harness the energy of things that already move there are tons of roles involving mechanical engineers whether its manufacturing a raw metal into an actual product or designing a business to business product or solution that can be used on the assembly line and lastly designing products that can be used by consumers in their daytoday lives so because of all this variety getting a degree in mechanical engineering doesnt necessarily give you a direct path into any one career but you can also say this for pretty much any kind of engineering because regardless of what type of engineering you take you will learn a lot about lots of different types of engineering if you do end up deciding to get a mechanical engineering degree you could end up working on some cool things like a spaceship or a mars rover and you can also work on some other basic things like a bicycle or a sprinkler but a lot of the skills in order to work as a mechanical engineer are very similar for example mechanical engineers generally understand the design process very well they understand part manufacturing taking things from an idea to a sketch to a 3d model to a prototype they understand how different materials might be better suited for different situations and they are well versed in many kinds of physics whether its thermodynamics fluid dynamics combustion measurement hydraulics control engineering mechanics or dynamics they know a lot of physics and all of those fields i just mentioned i didnt randomly pick out these actually happen to be a majority of the physics courses that you will be taking if you choose to do a mechanical engineering degree since not everyone knows what these physics terms mean im gonna throw up a translation into layman terms so that you can kind of get a general idea of what each branch of physics deals with on top of all of these physics basics you will also be learning basics from other fields of engineering like civil chemical and electrical engineering all of these courses are generally just to make sure that you can understand what the other engineers around you might be doing so once all of your basic physics courses and other engineering basics are out of the way you can take some upperyear courses which will be more specialized into a field or career that youre interested in this can be in things like control systems robotics logistics automotive engineering biomechanics vibration optics and even more usually you would pick the types of courses that line up with the career or the masters degree that you would like to pursue generally speaking these types of courses are probably going to be the ones that are the most relevant and most useful to you in your job in the first two to three years you would just be kind of picking up the basics so while were on the topic of jobs what can you do once you graduate with your mechanical engineering degree whats your starting salary going to look like and what are some companies that you can work for according to glassdoor the national average for an entrylevel mechanical engineer is 67 000 in the united states this value depending on your source can vary from between 60 to about 80 or 90 000 as a starting salary this is above the average american income and you have lots of room to grow because thats just your salary in the first year one of the reasons why this salary might not be as crazy as something like software engineering where they make upwards of one hundred thousand dollars as a starting salary is because you probably wont get the same stock options mechanical engineers generally dont live in high cost of living cities like software engineers do generally speaking a mechanical engineer would work in a large factory and in order to have the land for a large factory it needs to be somewhat affordable so you usually wont see them in the middle of a city so now lets name drop some of the most popular companies that hire mechanical engineers if youre competitive enough you might one day actually work for one of these companies but youre gonna have to really work your butt off the first one we have nasa every mechanical engineers dream and you can also become mark rober the famous mechanical engineer youtuber similarly to nasa we also have spacex and boeing who hire mechanical engineers after that we have lockheed martin which manufactures equipment for the us military you can also work at a big tech company like google apple and microsoft because they often require hardware designers and different types of things to cool their server rooms which the mechanical engineers can usually be responsible for you will also often see mechanical engineers in product design so they might be designing the shape and the casing for something like an iphone or a google pixel after this we have car manufacturers so companies like tesla and ford are really heavy on the mechanical engineering side and often hire hundreds if not thousands of mechanical engineers to run their factories and design their products and lastly some other cool ones that you might not have thought of are companies like johnson and johnson as well as disney and the main use for mechanical engineers from disney would be for their amusement parks at all of these jobs you would probably be assigned with doing one of the following tasks as i mentioned throughout the video first up we have design engineering which is used to design pretty much anything you can think of from planes to amusement parks to consumer products you might also be responsible for testing various manufacturing processes to make sure that the things youre manufacturing are within the product specifications and if your assembly line happens to fall apart you will usually be tasked with repairing it or finding someone to repair it for you lastly whatever your other field of interest might be say for example its robotics then naturally you would be working a little more with electronic circuits and robotics and prototyping in all of the above scenarios you will likely be working on a team of other engineers which is why its useful to know a little bit about their disciplines so that you kind of have a background when they come to you and ask you something that you might not know otherwise so lets say that youre either happy in your mechanical engineering job and youre thinking of doing a masters or you just want to switch careers and are looking to do a masters in mechanical engineering is it worth it and what would you learn in the degree one easy way to calculate if its going to be worth it is to take the cost of your lost salaries for going to school for two years for a masters plus the actual cost of tuition to attend the degree usually you dont want it to take more than 10 years to pay off the debts that you incur while going to school this obviously isnt the only way to calculate it you could also do your masters degree parttime while still working and that would actually help you a lot in upping your skills while also not missing out on a salary so lets say youve decided that financially it makes sense what are you actually going to learn in a masters of mechanical engineering the answer is it depends usually when you take a masters degree the goal is to specialize in something thats more niche and specific than your undergraduate degree so in line with this most mechanical engineering masters degrees are actually focused on specific fields so for example you could take a masters in automation and robotics masters and control systems masters in manufacturing masters in thermodynamics fluids and energy systems and a masters in nuclear energy all of these would be under the umbrella of the faculty of mechanical engineering and they would be more specific and more of a direct path into the career that youre interested in on top of this it would make you a lot more competitive when youre trying to get a job in the specific field that you chose because everybody else around you probably only has an undergraduate degree so thats definitely something to think about when youre evaluating if its worth it and if you want to go into your masters so that about wraps up everything you need to know about mechanical engineering its a very broad and general engineering field you can do lots of different things with a degree in mechanical engineering so if youre undecided this might be the degree for you generally speaking mechanical engineers are well respected and very good at what they do when it comes to designing and manufacturing products let me know if you found this video useful by leaving a comment down below also feel free to share it with someone who

Music good morning everybody good morning here we are on day two of our cruise this is a sea day yep and this is windjammers this is where were gonna grab breakfast this is the buffet yeah so were gonna go grab breakfast the regular um dining room isnt open yet so were gonna check it out and see what they have yeah uh for the plants today were just gonna just chill explore more of the ship yes theres some places we can see what else yeah see what else to do you ready ready it looks babe we got bacon we got bacon yeah probably every day here they got bacon nice good thank you brandon i usually typically get some cold cereal bananas some pastries but i want to see how the hot items are on this ship so they have some premade omelets they have different kinds i got the ham and cheese try out their corned beef hash some bacon asked for a little bit and thats how much they gave me and a hash brown so lets put it again and try it out i got their tosino which is like a fried pork theyre hashbrown as well with my over easy egg hashbrown and my hardboiled egg you know how i like hardboiled eggs ive noticed on this cruise this is really a fruity cruise so if youre a foodie you want to look into real caribbean because everything over there looked amazing and this is what im going to start out with but these cruises you pretty much eat every day and the food looks really good and you cant beat our view and you cant they have a beverage station where you can selfserve and get your own juice water and coffee but as soon as you sit down the staff comes around and asks what kind of drinks you want so if you cant hold all your plates and the drink at the same time theyll bring you out whatever beverage so we got our coffee delivered so they bring out um any sugar or uh so i think that the service is like these guys are on it so as soon as you sit down theyre like what what else can we get you anything anything you want i tried this hash um crumby fashion it is delicious it has a little southwestern flair to it its got the bell pepper onions typically its just the cubed potatoes and the columbia patch but now its got that southwestern flavor i like this a lot ive never seen a serve like this before so yeah its a winner they serve tosino here what tosino is really just like fried pork theyre very thinly sliced i just wanted to try it you can see theyre cooked very well you can tell its juicy this is just like a fried pork chop it has a little bit of sweet to it which is interesting but this is good i guess it needs a bowl of rice they even have curry this morning but i need my rice with my curry this is really good the tostino as you walk in uh they request that you wash your hands and these singers right here yeah they remind you they sing hand washing songs yeah we got a little bit of them yesterday right yeah its about 9am not too much going on no kind of quiet yeah this is the main um area the promenade right theres some cool planets up here were in the combination library card room nice and quiet in here seventh floor right in the middle yeah all the way forward right all the way forward yeah so a lot of tables and i do have a couple of computers so i guess if you have the internet package you can look up stuff right next to the main pool caddy corner from where johnny rockets is this way you could pick up your life jackets for like the little kitties and also right here is the towel stations where you can pick up your beach towels from or you can also request it through the steward in your stateroom first time seeing a turkey towel animal its a little jacuzzi time yeah a couple of them in the main pool area but theyre playing music pretty loud yeah so thats why we came back here maybe well go visit there later yeah so yeah this is very chill back here and whats interesting is that captain announced that he saw whales and so he announced over the pa that hey we decided to move the party to the main pool area yeah just chilling yeah theyre playing some music yeah its getting kind of warm too okay theyre waiting for the ice cream place to open yeah i cant believe that it doesnt open its already almost 10 30 am its not open yet no not yet were waiting Music its ice cream time ice cream time so the official hours 11 am to 5 pm thats the time the swirl place is open and this is pretty good ice cream yeah its a really nice sunny day its warm so its perfect and someone asked if they had strawberries so they didnt have strawberry this time i wonder if they do have strawberry another day maybe well have to try back later tomorrow lunch time were grabbing a quick bite from the local fresh loco yes im giving it a little light because i want to go see what the other food they have to offer here for lunch i just got some nachos they have some chili that they put on top i got some sour cream heres the cheese in there some queso cheese right okay so its cheese baby yeah yeah yep and lets take a bite so basically they put all the toppings on for you Music thats pretty good its not spicy at all but the chips are nice and fresh and cheese its not an overpowering cheese these are delicious yeah its like a standard nachos and i got a chicken quesadilla with some sour cream guacamole and some salsa rice and some carnitas so they also had beef chicken and tortillas burritos yeah so yeah give this a try yeah carnitas Music theyre tasty nice and moist maybe a pinch on the salty side but it does have good carnitas pork flavor its pretty good its nice and tender too Music and the quesadilla perfect bite mate yeah look at that the colors of mexico right there all right it is your standard flare its like the um yellow yellow cheddar or monterey jack trying to cheese piece of chicken tortillas nice and soft it has met my expectations thats great what do you do when youre on a cruise ship you have two lunches yes so we are finished with our mexican lunch yep now were in windjammers lets see what they have for the buffet we already saw whats in the dining room so we made you the dining room but were just going to check out and see what they have here yeah cause they might have similar items or the exact items yeah we dont know thats what were gonna walk through were about to find out they have major seafood going on here they have crawfish they have shrimp look at this it looks beautiful yeah Music so in the dining room i didnt see any of this this is a lot of seafood that they have up here so were going to share this place so we can still go to the dining room here is their baby shrimp im not sure what type of marinade were going to try it out theyre crawfish this is just cocktail sauce they have something some shrimp marinated in some sort of sauce this is baby scallop and just regular shrimp for the shrimp cocktail this looks good its a lot huh baby yeah i didnt get the mussels they had mussels they had like a little like a little small little um Music seafood little cup without different types of seafood in there i didnt get that we even had a seafood paella that i didnt even try they have a lot of stuff that stuff was not here yesterday some of the other stuff like that grilled steak and your grilled veggies your hot dogs and hamburgers that was all there yesterday so im feeling they serve that every single day so this one they dont so were going to go ahead and try some of this stuff out yeah what a variety right there shrimp cocktail just picking it up its nice and cold probably was on like a bed of ice or something here we go Music regular yeah good shrimp but it kind of reminds me of the uh shrimp cocktail they will serve inside the dining room for dinner how they give you like maybe five or six of these shrimps looks exactly like that very good anything else you want to try baby the scallops maybe these little baby scallops originally when i first saw it i thought they were like chickpeas i was like what is chickpeas doing in the seafood section that good a little bit spicy sauce on it almost like a spicy cocktail sauce um the taste of scallops are there even though theyre really tiny baby sized still has full of flavor for scallops and theyre all sort of cold good yeah its really good this is their marinated shrimpy lets try okay now i cant tell what its marinated with im gonna go ahead and peel this off there we go Music good shrimp i dont know what the marinade is but all i can taste is the shrimp flavor totes uh peel yourself shrimp thats a bit in the cocktail sauce its a good shrimp its good hearty shrimp so i only got a few pieces of crawfish only two since were still gonna go to the dining room there it is this is what it looks like a little small side theyre just okay they need something im not sure but maybe they need new orleans i need some old day or or something theyre just okay yeah theyre im sure theyre frozen you know theyre not like new orleans where they uh boil them fresh right so it tasted tasted kind of weird so im not gonna eat this one tastes kinda zinky so im not gonna eat this one zinky yeah i dont know what that means irony maybe they give you fresh bread for lunch and dinner so heres our bread basket yes i just touched your side yeah its really yeah definitely warm yup and they put butter in here yep one two three so we just ordered our lunch items and see how it is yes i have the smoked potato soup very creamy very potato forward with a hint of garlic so i have a feeling this is the garlic right here which is good nice and creamy i may share with them well see youll probably need some crispy bacon bits in there bacon that would make it right everything tastes better with bacon like mine i got the wedge salad with applewood smoked bacon bits and it comes with blue cheese but i asked for a ranch dressing instead thats a big salad it is good size goodsized wedge to make a good door stopper got the steak frites for lunch the size of the steak its pretty good it comes with the truffle fries so lets try this out thats for a medium temperature lets see that is a good flavored steak and its got a nice fake chew to it too it doesnt have that artificial tenderizer in it so it actually is a pizza steak and its got some some garlic a little garlic cloves but let me try some of these um truffle fries very mild and truffle fry though but they do give you some ketchup on the side yeah these fries are a little bit better than the ones they serve up in the buffet area this looks really good look at how big that piece looks lets go ahead and break off a piece of this very hearty fish see its very meaty look at that thats a mouthful that was a good size but great flavor great flavor and they have it in butter um potatoes mashed potatoes are very creamy so all those other capers without theres some sauce they have but im not overpowering it you can really taste that fish flavor and this is a perfect punch size and thats our key lime pie on the menus had to try it out its really good got the grain crust put some fresh whipped cream right here and a little baby key lime a little jelly i think this is a jelly one here we go try this out a little bit of fresh whip on it good color not quite like the ones in key west florida but it has a taste of key lime on it im surprised its not a little bit more tart than what it is its a little bit on the sweet side so its got that sweet lime type of flavor to it but the meringue is nice um this is um its good its good i mean its not bad ill probably eat most of it what is this we have the layered coconut cake a really light very coconutty wow not dry it on hey maybe well split it yeah its a very light cake i like this one all done with lunch everything was good it was very good yes um for as far as the steak um i think it was the same quality as if you saw into the buffet and got the grill steak there but after that it was good i am extremely full yeah i mean having three meals but even though the first two are kind of small yeah theyre kind of small each one but were extremely focusing dinners we have any time dining its a good thing we can have a late dinner yeah its always equivalent to having a lunch buffet yeah really right so we are here at studio b and theyre supposed to have ice skating on a ship are you skating on the ship yeah ive never seen ice skating on yeah so lets do it lets go check it out they have ice skating this is pretty cool its skating on the ship yeah right now its uh you can learn how to skate so you actually can skate on this ice Music oh my god thats the biggest one ive seen look at that this is Music Applause Music you got your new one now be careful Music so i know it seems like were just eating nonstop Music i should take about a two and a half hour nap yeah we did yeah so we have to get the ice cream before they close yeah calypso yeah but theres not too many people out because its kind of cold its windy yeah Music lets go inside im gonna check out the fitness center and see what it looks like here it is right here vitality at sea walk this way so this is the aerobics room yeah i have that bouncy ball thing yep inside there its like soul cycle right here all right did i hear you i used to be a basketball camp go Music yay we found the ships placard it was built in 2002 its 20 years old this year there it is made in finland right next to the rock climbing wall yep who knew 20 years old pretty good shape for what 20 years at five oclock theyre supposed to have a speed climbing event yeah over here but theres only two guys that came yeah theyre fast theyre actually pretty fast we thought theyre gonna kind of barely make it up but yeah these blew up those hit they fill up that rock yeah so its pizza time youre finally trying to yeah try it out here it goes i got a slice of cheese it is a lot smaller than what i thought it looks like a little kids pizza look a very thin crust and they give it to you by piece yeah by slice right so here we go theres a reason why the bottom crust is so stiff its a little cardboard like put the toppings on top the cheese is nice the pizza sauce is pretty good but its very um stiff not making you wanted to go back back and get more habit im glad i tried it but um yeah unless youre really in the mood for pizza ill probably skip this i got the pepperoni so you got a pepperoni paper no i got a fourth of a pepperoni right here baby okay so sorry i didnt see that one baby thats okay pepperoni pizza tastes like mama celeste the ones that you know the individual ones that you get for 99 cents at the market i like those but also reminds me of oh you got a lot more cheese on you than mine got a cheese bowl yeah lime dress is not as good Music tomato sauce its kind of there you can barely taste it ill taste the cheese but the cheese doesnt really have like a zesty flavor and pepperoni if i were in the mood i get it but to make a special trip here i probably Music not before dinner we thought we would make a stop at the bamboo room i saw that they have a hand shaking pina colada right right and so you know we love these especially in new orleans at the carousel bar so were going to have to try this out yeah this is only the second time we got our hand shaking right cheers babe cheers not bad alcohols a bit stronger in this one that nice pina colada coconut pineapple flavor to it this is good yeah its definitely different than the frozen type of definitely try this out its not one of their signature drinks but they do offer it right hand chicken viagra yes and you know what its only a dollar more than you get at the regular pool bars right and its much better yes it is its dinner time and were back at windjammers it is we didnt feel like dressing up for the dining room and it didnt have the food that we really wanted yeah were back at the buffet you can see the menus in advance on the uh on the app on the royal app but tonight in the buffet is chinese food night yeah so whats really interesting though is the buffet is open only for like a little bit over two hours its open from 6 45 to 9 yeah i believe that is adjusted because the number of people on the ship right and also the dining room is the same thing at least the my time dining is from 6 45 and 9 as well right so im im guessing if they have a lot more people here the hours are extended yeah it is most likely well lets go see what they got i have got the ultimate chinese food spread here because this is chinese food night i got some chinese spare ribs on a bone some gyoza beef and broccoli sliced pork loin thats off the carving station and i dont look like some sesame chicken noodles spring rolls some gyoza theres fried rice and down there baby yeah and the and the strength fried rice and the uh barbecue pork bun look at that its a lot of fun yep and were like the only ones in here well it just opened though too yeah you figure if it just opened maybe like a line of people outside waiting to come in but no no so yeah im gonna dig into this i got some beef and broccoli some shrimp fried rice and some gyozas and then they have like something called like a kuda bin it looks like chicken its right over here in this other side i gotta try it out it looks so interesting yeah its almost like what i got but you guys that different chicken right yeah different chicken i just took a bite of this i thought it was a sweet like a like a orange chicken or sesame chicken but its not its actually pork inside here but it is so juicy very light batter it has that semisweet glaze on it yeah these little pork nuggets right here are so far my favorite on this dish yeah theyre really good first thing when you come in you see the kuda bin so its chicken and it says it contains bacon but i dont know what it is ive never heard of it could have been if you heard about it put in the comments Music below its marinated with like a wine you can kind of taste that that wine taste its extremely juicy really juicy great flavor has a deep very deep wine flavor kind of even penetrated chicken not just in the skin its not spicy or enough its not spicy this would go perfect with some sort of starch like a potato or something like that which i had on the side i just wanted to try this right here and this nice moist chicken its good i try it were back at the casino so it operates a little bit different than what we used to uh all the machines take cash they do but when you cash out they give you a voucher just like vegas machines yeah they do and you just take your voucher from machine to machine right versus a carnival they put it back on your account right and then you have to redeem it that one right yeah so now were going to see if we have any luck hopefully well see maybe im playing the dancing club Music its about time i want something something it looks good im not dancing food Music all right look at that man crazy 88 cents on the lunar festival yeah heres a rarity we both walked out with some big money this is mine from dancing food this is from hot stuff and this is from that lunar one nice not bad we finally won yep Music Applause Music thats gonna wrap it up for our sea day here yep tomorrow is catalina and then the next day which is tomorrow is what wednesday yeah thursdays gonna be ah thursdays thursdays ensenada yeah wednesday is catalina thursdays in sonata then were back home on friday thats right yeah we have after dinner we got our cookies our girl scout cookies there we go that girl scout cookie time yeah we had some tea and uh we met up with uh auntie nancy um top of the family top story a bit yeah yeah and auntie sharon and yeah yep all good just yeah talk story text story yes then we caught a little bit of that show that you heard them singing and thats about it yeah were done for tonights a little bit after 10 right now thats late for us it is it is im glad we stayed out well uh quickly we invite you to subscribe yeah for those who arent subscribers yet yes and if you like this kind of uh goofy daily vlogs and other travel and food videos yeah consider subscribing yeah were a lot of fun yeah we might have fun at least thats a ruben gold thats right yep well i have a shout out mate oh you do yeah do it bill and lorna thank you so much for saying hi to us we saw them here on the ship and there was another family that we saw within the um promenade cafe promenade cafe yeah yeah so thank you thank you so much for saying hi to us yes so uh stay tuned for the next vlog which will be covering the highland yes weve been there before but were gonna check it out again yeah were gonna do a revisit yes yes so until that next adventure well catch you guys in the next one bye;Tosino

were taking the 15minute meal series to the land of breakfast because we all know how insane mornings can be whether youre trying to get your kids to school maybe you want to work out in the morning or you just start working really early whatever it is it doesnt matter but what is important is that you start your day off right with a nice homemade meal and thats what were covering in todays video my top four breakfast options that are all super delicious very customizable but most importantly they all come together in under 15 minutes were starting off very strong because i make this first breakfast dish more than anything in the kitchen probably every other day especially since ive had a kid oh my god my daughter loves these pancakes and theyre very nutritious theyre very filling and its a mix between eggs and bananas so if you cant choose between a savory egg breakfast and more of a sweeter breakfast this one combines them both and i think thats why i love it so much all you really need to remember to make these pancakes is this ratio right here for every banana use one egg so im using three medium bananas which has been my goto ratio it gives me a solid breakfast for three plus some leftovers for the next day so im gonna get the bananas in a bowl and start smashing and keep mashing them up so they really start to break down and turn into like a banana mushy pudding Music so we have our mixture here this is rather thin just eggs and bananas you dont want to cook this yet it will be a mess its only two more ingredients we need to thicken this up to make it a pancake batter so you can use any flour you want to get that result i tend to use a glutenfree flour just to lighten it up since its breakfast and one of my favorites is oat flour so im just going to do a few scoops this is all about consistency here you do not need an exact recipe to make these i encourage you not to use it just go by feel and then we do want to add some baking powder just to give them a rise i found that one teaspoon of baking powder is perfect for about three bananas so just adjust accordingly and well start whisking that and well see where were at for me right there thats too thin for a pancake batter so all im gonna do is just add another spoonful and a half youll get better at this over time as you make more of them this is straight up second nature to me at this point i make so many of them all right so that right there perfect were just looking for that pancake batter consistency so my pan is perfectly preheated at this point and ill scoop in just about i dont know a glob of oil im using coconut oil which is my goto but ive done it with butter which works great or any type of oil you have in the pantry and just start scooping in pancakes really whatever size you want whatever fits your pan so you can see theyve puffed up pretty nicely and that first batch is all about getting the temp right getting the timing right so if theyre not perfect totally fine but thats what youre looking for a nice golden brown rust oh that one a little under now these only need about a minute on the other side ill get them off get another batch in and start banging out pancakes Music i dont actually eat pancakes stack this high maybe maybe a four stacker six stacker is a bit aggressive but for the video look at the fluff no wheat flour in there still a nice fluffy pancake its sweet but not too sweet very nutritious and just satisfying ive been making these for years theyve ramped up since i had a kid and i am still not sick of them if these dont change your life just contact me directly send me an email let me know why oh four more thats it so 12 medium pancakes for three bananas and three eggs so weve got that pancake recipe thats your daily allpurpose driver but if you want to treat yourself to a more american style or english style breakfast with the meat the eggs the potatoes but you want to do it under 15 minutes this next breakfast is for you all right so this one youre going to need some where are you where are you where are you oh i already took it out of the fridge weve got some beautiful bacon and you want a bacon with a good bit of fat look at all that good stuff because were gonna render that out and use it for the potato which are right here potatoes any type well do and of course eggs two should be fine for this recipe you know thats a homegrown egg homemade Music Applause Music all right so potatoes in a bowl gonna salt these start that osmosis process so that moisture gets pulled out of potatoes let that go to work for a few minutes in the meantime perfect just a nice low heat on that you can see how its rendering beautifully and ive got about two minutes for that bacon finishes to just clean up a little bit pull that off perfect turn that heat to very low so this fat doesnt burn im gonna take a clean dish towel pop that right into the strainer potatoes and then just strain crucial potato juice all that water out oh yeah so thats a lot of fat in there im gonna reserve just a little bit of that to cook the eggs nothing goes to waste this is flavor and a beautiful cooking oil take a look at this nice and dry thats just a ball of dried potatoes right there thats what you want now you could stuff that entire potato thing and make a big pancake at the bottom its kind of high risk i think a lower risk option is just taking a mason jar lid stuffing it in to make a little hash brown or lava or whatever the hell you want to call it move that thats one its two and three and just flatten these out a little bit so i just realized something these are cooking right now and if i want to wait on them to fry the eggs were losing time so if we want this meal done in 15 minutes im just gonna poach the eggs in this pot right here luckily i have an induction burner and ill be ready in like one minute but keep that in mind get the water going before everything if you dont have induction so these are ready to flip and now that im not frying my eggs i can use the rest of the bacon fat for the other side oops kind of broke apart fine oh yeah and hash browns my friends just gonna turn that down a little bit while we poach these eggs all right so very gentle simmer here about two tablespoons of vinegar thats apple cider vinegar ill just precrack these real quick give it a swirl right in there come out oh damn it man down man down i dont really have the right instrument here into some ice water maybe round two will be a little better well swell swell all right final leg poaching i think these are perfect lets see underside yeah thats where i want it oh damn thats good ill grab that poached egg and we will plate it up rip this bacon up into some pieces not the best poached egg ive ever seen but it will do im going to hit it with a little bit of this purple sauerkraut that i made totally optional a little bit of chives would be nice as well if i had them this will have a nice tangy kick there you go i mean it doesnt look great but thats gonna taste looking good so now some of you might have noticed that insane thing hanging out in the intro this is the opposite of 15 minutes Laughter this is i dont know 72 hours or something like that i was actually missing bannetons so i shoved the entire dough into a loaf pan which i never do and baked it off and for the love of sourdough now you can eat this totally alone this is not a part of this 15minute meal but i feel like i have to share this with all of you i have to share this with someone this moment of cutting into this thing so this is a sourdough sandwich loaf oh my sweet baby jesus have you ever seen anything like that this is just like one of those you know make it a mess throw it on some bread if you have it i love that poached egg on there because it just soaks into the potatoes thats a bite thats a bite thats all i can say that is a bite oh my god so a few components in that meal you can see i was kind of racing around the kitchen but if youre looking for a good weekend breakfast thats still quick thats your answer now ive got to gather a few ingredients for the next two recipes but in the meantime i wanted to tell you about todays sponsor which is simply safe now i recently bought this house and i was looking for a robust security system that was affordable and also easy to install something that i can install myself and simply safe was the perfect match for my needs you simply go to their website and design the exact system and features you want for your own home security now every system comes with the base hub and the keypad which is the brains of your security then on top of that i picked up a few door sensors some water detectors to warn me about any potential basement leaks a programmable locking system and some indoor and outdoor cameras and setting up the system was a breeze you plug in the main hub stick on the keypad and youre off to the races each additional feature has a tiny button on it that you press to sync it to the main hub which makes it extremely easy with the wireless install i set up one outdoor hd camera to get a nice view of the front of the house and then the other on the side of the house which i might move at some point but right now im trying to track down some pesky deer who seem to be using my garden as a salad bar so im all up and running and feeling a lot more secure and if any of you out there are looking for a really intuitive and affordable home security system option well simply safe is running their biggest sale of the year where you can get 50 off or more on your home security so check out simplysafecom pro home cooks below in the description to learn more now lets collect some ingredients starting to get very cold out here for these little chickens chickens are currently malting so theyre kind of hibernating right now so im not getting too many eggs but i think five should be oh hey five should be good for the last recipe one more thing to get so this fig tree right here was planted years ago i additionally added three more fig trees just the other week so this whole section will just be fig mania but you can see see all these figs coming in i dont know if theyll all ripen but this thing right here i put bags around the ones that are ripening because theyll get destroyed by ants once they get sweet now that is gonna be perfect for the next recipe now sometimes you just wake up and you want something warm to kick start your day especially now that its getting chilly outside and every cuisine has their own type of porridge just cozy goodness to start the day now my goto for that meal is oatmeal and were not talking the overnight oats none of that im going to show you how to make fresh cooked oatmeal with these grains right here good oldfashioned rolled oats now for the liquid what i have right here is some homemade almond milk you can use any type of nut milk you can use regular milk you can use water but what i like to do in the beginning of most weeks is some homemade almond milk which is really simple you just soak almonds overnight and then my favorite way to extract the goodness out of them is a masticating style juicer like this but you could give them a nice highpowered blend and then strain off the milk as well and then you have beautiful almond milk for a few days or just buy the storebought stuff i dont care its just not as good get your pan on a medium heat i always start with a two to one ratio of milk to oats and then ill add milk if i need to thin it out so about one and a half cups rolled oats to three cups of liquid im not gonna waste all my precious almond milk so ill do two cups of almond milk one cup of water i like adding bold flavors to my oatmeal so its not boring but season it however you want im gonna do a little orange zest a little bit of the juice also a little bit of ginger and then my favorite oatmeal ingredient of all fresh nutmeg you can just use the same microplane see that oh so good if you dont have any of that around just use cinnamon a little bit of salt is very important not much just a little bit to bring those flavors out and well just let that slowly cook and thicken up im gonna wait till the end to add my sweetener weve already got a little bubble you can see how much its thickened up in like a minute im gonna turn that down to the lowest setting and let that cook away and in the meantime i will prepare my toppings got some kiwi all right lets see whats going on in this fig slice it up blueberries leftover from the pancake since this is mush a little bit of fresh almond to add some crunch ill just rough chop these so heres where were at after about four minutes it looks good i like waiting to add the sweetener and you can use whatever sweetener you like honey maple syrup regular sugar but i find if you add a really good say maple syrup right at the end you just retain actual flavor of the maple syrup rather than it losing its flavor as it cooks down over time now lets give that a taste i could tell right when i did it since i was filming and i just poured the maple syrup in there a little too much maple syrup actually ill just water it down slightly that could help but sweetening something is just like salting something its kind of your preference youre basically just seasoning it with sugar so lets see if that water helped a little bit the actual flavoring is unbelievable that orange and nutmeg combo wow but a little less maple would have been great some of that fig in there wow thats some dynamic flavor right there good texture exactly what i wanted just a warm bowl of goodness i feel like with the rise of these other trendy things like overnight oats and chia bowls a lot of people dont know how to make just a good bowl of oatmeal so i wanted to show you that because for me this is a goto and its great to have in your arsenal so ive got the perfect final breakfast option for you something i make all the time especially if i have some guests over my house and i need something a little more substantial mastering a frittata not only can a frittata be made in under 15 minutes its also the best way to clear out your fridge of any ingredients and thats what were about to do right now im using a little six inch pan here with a high lip which is perfect for frittata but something bigger will work fine as well the frittata just might not be as thick and like all of these recipes you got to get that pan preheating immediately to save you some time and while the pans preheating were going to prep all of the veggies that are going to this frittata so im just going to do a quick slice on about half an onion and the same thing ive got a leftover pepper in the fridge and ill just slice that up nice and thin so im going to get a good bit of olive oil in my pan ill dump in my veggies start frying those off and while those are frying ill work on my final veggie which is some mushroom but again very customizable use what you have this works great with spinach you could throw in some broccoli in there you could even throw in some sweet potatoes picking the perfect amount of eggs is a bit of a guesstimate you kind of learn over time what ratios makes the perfect frittata i only have five eggs because the chickens are going into a bit of a hibernation so thats gonna have to do but i think it should be fine actually what im gonna do for that almond milk from before and of course use any milk product about a quarter cup of that were not making a quiche so its not like half and half just a little bit all right so you can see how nice these have cooked down in just about five minutes tiny bit more salt to season those mushrooms now by far the most important thing you see all that oil residual oil in the bottom of the pan we want that your pan can not be dry or it will stick im even just gonna add a little bit more i know it seems like a lot but this is just the one dish you cannot skimp on oil you dont want a sticking free tata let me dump ill turn this down just a little bit now what i like doing is just kind of pushing out the sides just like an omelette just to get it going and then once you do that trust the crust two more ingredients some chopped parsley sprinkle that right on top and some cheese ive got some cheddar here any melting cheese will work feta is great as well just create that right on top let those chunks just kind of fall in there now this is where technique comes into play weve got that flame on just the medium low heat slowly building a crust on the bottom that is direct heat from the bottom now this is gooey up here uncooked egg thats why once weve developed the crust on the bottom im gonna throw it in the broiler develop a crust from the top and cook it through it might take a few times to really get it perfect ive made this dish hundreds of times but you will at some point now check this out if i just peel away because i use that oil and i trust the crust you can see the browning in there happening brownish so now at this point were going over to the broiler open were preheated let that broil for about two to three minutes depending on how hot your broiler is all right lets check it out wow brown bubbly it puffed up a little bit here we go lets let it cool right here now one thing thats not really 15 minutes about this dish is the cooling time you could eat that right now or you know in a minute when it cools down a bit but if you want to make sure this thing slips right out on the cutting board unscathed youve got to let it set a bit and just cool down for i dont know five minutes at least so ill clean up and hopefully weve got a golden frittata see look at this its already kind of slipping away easily you can flip it out or just kind of pull it pretty clean pan trust the crust pizza pie moist completely filled with veggies even veggie action right there i hate to say it but i think thats a handheld action not for pizza bottom crust oh my god that one came out good to be honest i so rarely make omelets because i think this right here you dont have to make three four omelets for everyone you just make one breakfast pizza its fluffy its tender i mean its perfect theres not really too much more to say about it so thats it thats my top four at least my first four i definitely have a few more just like the dinners want to see more quick 15minute breakfast hit me up down in the comments ill come in with four more thanks again to simplisafe for sponsoring this video and click

Hello there and thanks for joining me Im professional artist Aaron Rutten This video is a guide for artists who are completely new to digital art Ill show you what tools youll need to make digital art And Ill answer some commonly asked questions that beginners have about getting started with digital art woosh sound First lets start with the tools youll need to create digital art Digital art is made on a computer so youll need a computer You probably have one if youre watching me right now Your computer can be a desktop a laptop a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet computer like the iPad or the Surface Pro A desktop or a laptop computer is better because youll be able to work on larger images store a lot of artwork and because desktops can be far more powerful than a phone or tablet So there wont be as much lag while youre drawing The advantage to working with a mobile device is that you arent tethered to your home or office Now in addition to your computer youll also need some art software This is also known as a program or an app Theres a few different categories of art software Theres free art software and theres paid art software Theres also software for desktop computers and software for mobile devices Now Im not going to go into a whole lot of detail about all the different art applications because there are a ton of them But I do have several videos which Ill link to that will show you the different programs that I recommend depending on whether youre looking for free paid desktop or mobile art applications But I will say that out of all the applications Ive tried Corel Painter is definitely my favorite and thats the one that I use for the majority of my work I dont do a whole lot of painting on my phone but when I do I like the Infinite Painter app and the ArtRage app And Ill also mention that some drawing tablets come bundled with free or trial art software Drawing tablet Whats a drawing tablet Im sure if youre at the point of searching for digital art videos youve probably at least dabbled in Microsoft Paint using your mouse to make crude drawings that could be put to shame by any threeyearold And Im sure that you notice that drawing with a mouse feels a lot like drawing with a rock And thats really about how sophisticated drawing with a mouse is Now I dont mean to sound like Im knocking rocks Rocks were very popular with prehistoric artists but eventually we invented the pencil and things got much easier The mouse is a rock Its crude and its difficult to use but you can draw with a mouse And some artists are quite good with it However I wouldnt recommend it because a tablet is much easier to use and you can do more with a tablet than you can do with a rock But I also know that not everyone has access to a tablet so I dont want to discourage anyone from getting into digital art if their only barrier is owning a tablet People made amazing artwork throughout the 1980s and 1990s using only a mouse and continue to do so to this a day If you must draw with a mouse thats perfectly fine but you should consider getting a vector program like Adobe Illustrator Inkscape or Microsoft Expression Design because it will be much easier to control with your mouse So third on the list of things that youll need is an input device That could be a mouse that could be a tablet that could be a mobile device that has a pen builtin That could be your finger on your tablet Regardless of which of these you choose youll need something that can function as your pen So Im going to break this down into two categories desktop and mobile Lets start with desktop If youre working on a desktop youll be using a drawing tablet also known as a graphics tablet You may have heard them referred to as Wacom tablets Some popular models are the Intuos and the Cintiq A Windows or a Mac operating system are required for these kind of tablets Linux is also supported if youre computer savvy enough to install the special Linux driver The advantages to working on a tablet are that youll have way more control over your pen pressure sensitivity and opacity using the pen to change the width of your line or the opacity of your stroke rather than having to constantly change sliders to choose the size of your brush and the opacity Youll also have a much larger drawing surface a better quality pen a tablet is more comfortable and more intuitive to draw with and in some cases you might even have other features that are very handy like express keys that you can assign to commonly used shortcuts So a drawing tablet will work really well if you have a desktop or a laptop computer but what if you have a mobile device As mobile painting is becoming more capable a lot of artists are drawing on a phone or a tablet computer such as the iPad These devices have their tablets builtin so you dont need to purchase one separately However not all tablets and phones support pen pressure detection And thats really important for getting a natural drawing experience You can do all of your painting with your finger but thats barely a step up from a rock I recommend choosing a mobile device that recognizes pen pressure and comes with a pressuresensitive stylus Some tablets like the iPad not counting the iPad Pro do not support pen pressure by default But you can purchase a stylus that can sense pen pressure such as the Wacom Bamboo or the Wacom Fine Line Not all styli yes styli not styluses can sense pen pressure So make sure to read the specs for your stylus to make sure both your device and your art app are supported Now lets talk a little bit about drivers Drivers are the software that tells your computer how to make the tablet work If your drivers are missing or incompatible with your computer your tablet probably isnt going to work Its best to choose a newer tablet if youre using a newer computer because older tablets may work on newer computers and newer tablets may work on older computers but theres no guarantees There are lots of new and old drivers online so do your research first before choosing a tablet If the tablet youre considering has a description or a specifications area look for the supported operating systems to make sure that your operating system will work with that tablet In the past drivers used to come on a CD but since a lot of newer computers dont use CD drives anymore typically youll download those drivers from a website Youll want to go to the manufacturers website for your tablet and look on their Drivers page And make sure that the drivers are available for your operating system before you purchase your tablet Its also worth mentioning that at a certain point companies stop making drivers for newer versions of Windows and Mac so you will want to keep that in mind You may find that your tablet was working fine with Windows 8 but then you upgrade to Windows 10 and suddenly the tablet doesnt work And the company doesnt bother to put out a new driver for that operating system because that tablet is no longer supported Now generally speaking Wacom is really good about updating their drivers all the time for new operating systems And its pretty easy to find older versions of their drivers I cant say the same for other companies In my experience most tablet driver support isnt nearly as good as Wacoms is Now lets talk about some optional things that you really dont need but they will make your life much easier The first is a secondary monitor or screen Having an extra screen will make it much easier to work because you can distribute your work across multiple screens I use three screens I have my digital art application on one screen a reference image on another screen and if I want to have some notes or my email open on another screen I can do that The second option is a computer that is optimized for digital art Optimizing your computer for digital art isnt very hard to do if you have a list of what you need I have a great PDF guide that I will link to in the description of this video That will tell you about all the different parts that youll need to optimize your computer for digital painting And the last set of tools that youll need to make digital art are tutorials And fortunately for you you know a guy who makes tutorials Clears throat Thats me Youll want to watch some tutorials that will teach you how to draw on a tablet tutorials that teach you how to use your software and youll want to learn some of the important fundamentals for beginners I have a ton of videos for beginners The fundamentals that I would concentrate on starting out would be Layers how to choose color image size and resolution basic sketching with primitive shapes and saving backing up and file management So those are all of the tools that you will need to make digital art Now lets answer a few commonly asked questions that beginners might have about getting started with digital art First how much does it cost Well prices can vary quite a bit depending on what your needs are If youre on a really tight budget there are lots of free digital art apps You might be able to find a used tablet online or locally at a used computer store on Craigslist or at a thrift store for under 50 You might also be able to find a used computer I dont think anything running an operating system older than Windows 7 would be a good choice but Ill leave that up to you If you do buy a used tablet or a used computer just make sure that the operating system youre using on that computer is compatible with that particular tablet You may need to download the tablet drivers online to make the tablet work on your computer Now if youre not on a tight budget but you dont want to spend a ton of money at a minimum youll probably need to spend about 80 for a decent entrylevel tablet Free software is fine to use and hopefully you already have a computer If not youll have to spend a little bit more for the computer If you want a more professional set up youre looking at about 500 to 4000 dollars depending on what you buy And thats including the tablet the software and whether or not you have to buy a computer Now I know the next question on your mind is What tablet should I buy First let me say that I get this question multiple times a day And it kind of irritates me because Ive put so much time into creating videos that help to answer that question So please do not ask me which tablet to buy ever Because honestly I cant really answer that question Only you can decide what is best for you So youll need to do some research and decide for yourself which tablet is best based on your needs Fortunately I make that research easy because I have several videos that recommend tablets If you watch those videos youll have a much better idea of what to buy Theres also a store on my website which lists all the digital art products that I recommend Here are some quick tips you can use when shopping for a tablet Dont buy the cheapest tablet There are lots of imitation brands that are poor quality buggy and frustrating to install And they may not work with your computer If you can afford it buy a Wacom tablet Wacom makes the best quality tablets and has excellent customer support And they update their drivers often Buy the largest tablet you can afford if you have the room for it because a large drawing surface is much easier to draw on Dont be fooled by all the numbers that are thrown at you Youll see numbers for the tablet resolution pen pressure levels the report rate all of these different things And these specs are slightly important but not as important as the size or the quality of the tablet Obviously larger numbers are better but dont let that be the main reason youre choosing that particular tablet You would have to pay really close attention while youre drawing to notice a difference between a tablet with 1024 levels or 2048 levels of pen pressure If you cant afford the tablet that you want get something similar or less expensive to use until you can afford something better If youre new to digital art and youre not sure that its something youll stick with consider getting a small or less expensive tablet And then upgrade later if you decide to continue working digitally So now you have a good idea of what to buy where can you buy a tablet You can buy them online which might be the easiest on Amazon or on eBay Or they are sold in some retail stores for example Best Buy carries Wacom tablets The next commonly asked question is How long does it take to get used to drawing on a tablet Everyone is different but I would say about 2 weeks to 2 months of consistent practice will get you on track with drawing on your tablet It really isnt that difficult but it does take a little bit of practice If you want a little bit of help building up your handeye coordination consider tracing over images because that works really well The next question is How is it working digitally different than working traditionally Theres no need to replenish your materials and art supplies its easy to begin work with minimal setup theres no messy cleanup its easy to take a break and resume work on your painting later you can correct mistakes more easily theres less risk of messing up your art when youre experimenting and its easier to make prints because you dont have to photograph or scan anything Another question that I get asked a lot is Do I have to choose between digital or traditional or can I do both No You dont have to choose You can do both Digital art is just a medium Chalk is a medium watercolor is a medium pencil is a medium And you dont have to choose between one or the other you can use any medium you want to make your art You can even combine digital with traditional art which is really fun And the last question is Do you have any tips for getting better at drawing in general Yes I do I have two great videos one is called 10 Drawing Tips for Digital Artists And the other is called 10 Mistakes Digital Artists Make Those videos will be very helpful Alright so that brings us to the end of this video I hope by now you have a better understanding of what youll need to make digital art and how to get started creating it If this video was helpful to you please return the favor by buying your tablet and software from the store on my website I get

Music hey everyone its jenna welcome or welcome back to my channel todays video is going to be all about making our homes cozier spaces and im just gonna give you a list of really practical easy to follow tips and ideas to really achieve that warm inviting and cozy feel to your space so if youre familiar with this channel you all know that things are going to be very budgetfriendly in this video but still give you that really highend designer feel so im going to take you on a little tour of my home and show you the things that i did to make my space feel that way so without further ado lets get into the video okay so the first thing you can do to make your home feel a lot cozier is decorate with wood and since wood is a natural organic material it really helps to ground a space and it can really help give a room a much warmer homeier feel and just make your decorating feel really down to earth and inviting pieces like dining tables coffee tables and side tables are really great places to start however i always like to take it one step further with wood decor in my space and also layer in a bunch of wooden accent pieces as well i love using rustic weathered picture frames and i really like to display all my wooden utensils in my kitchen crock and display cutting boards against the backsplash to really warm up the look of the countertop area another place we added wood was with beams on the ceiling in our bedroom and not only does this help add warmth to all of the white in the space but it also helps dry your eye up creating the illusion of a taller ceiling now when adding wood accents they dont always have to match in tone i get a lot of questions about this and in fact sometimes a little contrast in wood tones is really visually pleasing so the more wood you add to a space the warmer its appearance becomes and the cozier your space will feel so here in our dining room i decided to warm it up a bit and accent our lighter dining table with some darker wood tones with the lazy susan and our little plant stand and i think it just really gives this space some visual interest another accent piece i love to use are blanket ladders and blanket ladders are a great way to add wooden warmth to a blank white wall and not only do they add organic interest to the design but they also add height and an opportunity to also add another layer of coziness with hanging textiles on them as well now in my space something that i feel like really elevates the coziness to the next level is using aged and weathered wood and the aging and coloring of primitive wood is just something thats really hard to replicate so when you have pieces with that natural chipping splintering and groovy texture it just really helps add that dimensional warmth to the space and you can see here how this primitive stool just really seems to pop against the plain smooth base of the shelf and a lot of people ask me where i get my weathered wood pieces from and i usually source them from local antique shops in my area i think its fun to kind of stumble upon them but there are also a couple of online retailers who sell similar antiques which i will link below but do not think that you have to pay these expensive antique prices to get this look places like hobby lobby sell really similar looking weathered stools for a fraction of the price of the real antique ones and tuesday morning also has a really good selection of faux antique wood bowls and accent pieces for really reasonable prices as well so definitely check them out if youre looking to accent your home with some weathered wood another way that you can make your home cozy is by layering your lighting and what i mean by this is basically having multiple different light sources right next to each other for example in this bedroom we have the bedside lamp the picture lamp and our fan all within the same sight line and this just makes for a really luxurious feel and when you have a bunch of light sources at night time it just really helps your space feel cozy and homey another place that we did this in was our living room in the corner we have a tall floor lamp to add some height and then i layered in a smaller vintage desk lamp and this was another find from a local antique shop and its actually from the 1930s and i love all the character and dimension the chippy paint gives this piece its so cozy and convenient to have all of these light sources in this little corner this is where i love to curl up with a book or a magazine in the evenings and it may seem a little redundant to have two light sources but layering your lighting is actually a very high end and designer look and i love the cozy homey feel it gives this room another place where i layered my lighting was the kitchen we have lots of lighting in here with the pendant lights the recess lights the stove light and i just decided to add one more with this cute little tabletop lamp that ive shown in many other videos but i love all of the warm light that this piece gives to my countertops when im cooking and the designer look that it adds to the countertop as well another way to create a cozy space is to decorate with books and i love the inviting relaxing aesthetic that books create and dont think that you have to go spend a lot of money on expensive coffee table books a lot of the books that i use in my decor are all thrifted and at my local thrift store you can get a large hardcover coffee table book for a dollar and i typically look for book bindings that are neutral in color and bonus points if its about a subject that resonates with me now one of my goto styling ideas is just using a small stack of thrifted books as a little riser for a vase this just really helps give your decor a little bit of added visual interest and helps everything to look really effortlessly styled this technique can look great on a side table a console table to use on a desk or coffee table or even on a shelf for shelf styling now a practical spin on book decor is using storage books i love my storage books theyre great for hiding remotes and smaller games in a living room right now i actually have them in my kitchen to hide and store our meal delivery kit cards and not only is it nice and convenient having them out on the counter but they double as really pretty decor as well so another thing that kind of goes along with book decor is adding a decorative magazine holder to a space and this can really give a reading corner a super cozy feel and my guests always reach for these magazines when theyre over so if you dont want to pay for a bunch of magazine subscriptions you can just sign up to receive designer catalogs for free and you can still get a ton of inspiration from them and stay up to date on all the current designer trends by flipping through them and getting some inspiration another thing you can do to make your space feel more cozy and homey is to incorporate woven decor so decor pieces made out of seagrass or rattan that have a woven wicker look to them can really do wonders when it comes to warming up your space whether its just investing in some smaller accent pieces or hanging a thrifted basket on the wall and then popping some stems into it adding wovens into your space can really be a cheap and simple way to have a large impact on the overall look and feel of your room one of my goto ways to add wovens is by incorporating storage baskets into my decor not only does this add a touch of a warmer texture to my space but it also gives me some really pretty and practical storage solutions in our bedroom this blank space next to our desk had always bothered me so i recently added a set of lidded baskets to fill it in and i love the way the texture of these baskets plays off of the surrounding woods and fabrics to really soften the space and give it that homey inviting feel another place you can incorporate wovens is with your furniture our outdoor patio set is woven and i love all of the texture and warmth that it brings to our outdoor space alright so next up another way that you can make your space appear a lot more cozy is by adding wall moldings to your walls and this can really help your space feel a lot more finished and custom and the detailing that it adds to the wall just gives your eye something to focus on making the room feel a lot more welcoming and therefore cozy this was actually mike and is first ever real diy project together and its crazy how much depth it can add to a space we first just did a single accent wall in our guest bedroom and the transformation really surprised us so it actually motivated us to do it again in our workout room this time we did the entire room but only had the moldings go three quarters of the height of the room and we did a little lip on the top and i painted it agreeable gray by sherwin williams so my goal for our workout room was to make it really inviting and cozy and i just feel like the wall moldings in here really made all the difference for setting that homey foundation that i wanted our entryway also came with wayne scotting when we moved in and i love this subtle added detail and dimension that it gives our entryway to make it feel really warm and welcoming when you walk in the door alright so another surefire way to add a touch of coziness to your space is to layer in textured fabrics a really easy affordable way to do this is by adding in blankets these chunky faux fur throws are some of my favorite goto blankets for adding soft warm and subtle texture to a room i also love this similar larger pottery barn one that i have for our bedroom i sleep with this every night and i love that im able to just throw it on top of the maid bed for some added visual interest bedding is a great place to add in some subtle textures i love to keep my colors and patterns really simple but make a statement with the variety of different textures that i use in my bedding in our guest bedroom we have jute linen and cotton and i love that each layer has a slightly different feel to it in our bedroom we also have a white waffle duvet cover that i love the look of as well you can also add texture and softness with curtains the ones we used in our bedroom were from ikea and i love the light casual fabric on them they help soften the room but the fabric choice keeps it from feeling too formal another easy and affordable thing you can do to make your space feel cozy is to incorporate scent and obviously candles are a nobrainer when trying to create a restful homey ambiance but there are plenty of other ways you can incorporate scent as well we have scent sticks which are really great because you dont have to burn them but they are constantly releasing smell and all you have to do is turn the sticks upside down when you want a little bit of a refresh another fun decor scent piece are apollo santos sticks and these are wooden sticks harvested from the palo santo trees so its important to find sticks that are sustainably harvested but essentially you light the stick on fire let it burn and then blow it out and the smoke is supposed to cleanse the air and bring positivity to your space and its also used for relaxation and meditation i just love the way they look when used in decor also so lastly another way i like to disperse scent through my home is by using pillow sprays and you can get them at tj maxx and marshalls for really affordable prices and its a great way to enhance your bedtime routine to just mist over your pillow and let the relaxing scent help you fall asleep all right everyone that about wraps up this video i hope that you all enjoyed it if you did please give this video a thumbs up it really helps to support my channel and if

Applause Music Applause Music guess whos back back back back again again again its me hello everyone welcome back to my channel I hope youre all having a very lovely day or welcome to my channel if youre new here stick around join the fam press the little subscribe button down life anyway almost four years ago I uploaded a video called ten easy hairstyles for short hair and now four years later science has happened Ive got older and hairs growing longer so this is ten easy hairstyles for long hair Im so creative so I put together a list of ten of my favorite hairstyles Im not the kind of person that spends ages on my hair I like to get it done quickly something easy to do Im not the best at hair Im gonna be honest so if youre looking for some really extravagant new hairstyles this maybe isnt the video for you but if youre looking for some simple easy and really pretty hairstyles grab yourself a cup of tea and carry on watching so here we go with hairstyle number one so first of all Im starting off by brushing through my hair then Im gonna take a little comb please ignore this piece of hair I have at the front it doesnt know where it wants to go then Im just giving myself a middle parting and putting the top half of my hair up in a clip never my friends should you forget your heat protectant spray whether youre straightening curling I dont care protect your hair then Im just going to straighten at the entire bottom layer of my hair I like to section it off because I feel like it makes it more thorough Music rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair then Im gonna do exactly the same with the top layer well you all know how to straighten out hair the point Im trying to make is you can have it neat and tidy or you can add some dry shampoo and mess it up a little bit thats how I tend to wear it flip it upside down judge it about Oh sometimes I like to put the top half up so Im just brushing it all in to the same direction tying it with a hair tie putting bits out of it to make it a bit messy I really like this its super cute and super easy Music literally the bane of my life so for this next hairstyle Im going to brush my hair and then use the pointy kiama to give myself a side parting not too far to the side were not going for 2010 vibes this hairstyle is kind of like an easier version of a waterfall braid sorry first of all take the first section of your hair split it into three and begin a French braid if youre not familiar with French braids carry on watching this video you can learn a bit later on so once the braid is a little bit further back along my head this is difficult to explain but instead of threading the piece of hair closest to your ear into the braid youre going to take that piece of hair out and put it elsewhere I put it in my mouth its disgusting but it is easy and instead youre gonna pick up a new piece of hair from underneath the braid every time you have a piece of hair that dangles down you should get a feel for which piece of hair that is put it out of your way and again pick up a new piece of hair then youll be left with a braid looking like this I feel like if it explained that very badly Im sure thered be a better tutorial somewhere else on YouTube Music next up were back to a middle part in but about halfway down my head I brush my hair all backwards this hairstyle is super easy I just feel like it makes it look so much neater so as you can see Im just gathering all of the hair at the back of my head and were gonna do a low ponytail I told you it was super easy but we are going to jazz it up a bit I always then take my hands place them gently on my head and push my hair forwards to mess it up I also pour little bits of hair out of the front of the hairstyle and then here she is a cute little headband to finish the look I thought this is really elegant really easy kind of gives me disney princess vibes this next hairstyle is very similar so again Ive brushed all my hair into the same direction and then Im just twirling my hair into a bun super simple taking a headband wrapping it around the bun and then Im just taking a bobby pin to secure any of the rogue pieces I personally like this hairstyle to look a little bit neater okay maybe this one is a bit more Disney Princess a girl can dream next up Im gonna flip my hair over there she goes Ill whip my hair back and forth and then I brush it all my hair into the same direction were gonna go for a high pony this time so its much easier to do it upside down obviously when you secure your pony tail you can leave it you can have it neat some people prefer neat and tidy Im just not really that kind of gal so again I mess it up I pull bits out and I think this looks a lot more casual Music for this hairstyle Im using this curler which I got on Amazon Ill leave a link to it in the description down below its only a cheap one but I really like that its got a wide barrel again the clip in my hair up and using my heat spray Im ashamed to say that I do wear a glove when Im curling my hair I know Im embarrassed but I burned myself so much then the first couple of pieces of hair that I curl towards the front of my face I always curl away from my face its a lot more flattering and it frames your face really nicely as you can see while Im curling Im purposely not curling the end of my hair its just gonna give you a hair a slightly more casual finish as opposed to full glam bouncy curls and also as I slide the curler out Ill just hold the curl in my hand for a couple of seconds let it cool and for me this helps my curls last longer and just like magic shes all done then the only thing I do is run my fingers through my hair break the curls up a little bit and Bobs your uncle Music this next hairstyle is a personal favorite of mine so as you can see Im taking the front two sections of my hair and were going to leave them out sorry girls youre not included then Im just taking a layer of hair behind those pieces and tying it into a little pony I think this is another hairstyle that frames your face really nicely it gives me ariana grande vibes so for this one you want a middle part in and then youre also going to create another party in about an inch away and youre going to create this diagonally Im gonna be honest Im not the best at this hairstyle but it looks super pretty and its definitely one that I want to practice more so here Ive tied the bottom section of my hair to keep it out of the way and then the section of hair between the two Parthians and French braiding howd you get to the back of your head you could tie your French braids off with a little elastic thats definitely what I would do if I did this hairstyle with straight hair but as my hair was curly this time I decided to carry the plat on because I thought a little plaque would look pretty amongst the curls although as you can see here my arms were aching by this point then youre going to do exactly the same on the other side create a diagonal parting tie the bottom section of hair out of the way and create another little French braid French braids definitely get better with practice so if youre struggling you can do it my friend just have persistence I look so tired in this clip I am literally done with this Music dadada this is my most worn hairstyle at the minute so middle parting tying off one half of your hair this is how I do my two french braids so first of all the front section of your hair youre going to split into three pieces then imagine youre braiding your hair every time you take a piece of hair from one of the edges youre going to add a piece of hair to that section that youre holding fold it over the middle piece and then imagine youre taking a piece from the other side add a new piece of hair to it and then place that piece of hair over the middle keep going Im still trying to get my French braid further around the back of my head it is difficult on yourself I would definitely say it would be easier to practice on someone else first and then once youve got the hang of it attempt it on yourself but trust me it took me a long time to get the hang of a French braid its not easy I hope Ive explained that well but if youre still unsure again Im sure theres lots of French braid tutorials on YouTube where theyll explain it thoroughly and you might be able to see what theyre doing a little bit better if I can find a good example Ill link it in the description down below yeah these French braids were definitely not my best work Im gonna admit it now this is probably the worst French braid Ive ever done in my life but Im gonna assume thats because Ive been filming this video for over two hours and I cannot feel my arms right now my arms ache so bad so apologies for this but you get my drift its two french braids that theres plenty of tutorials on youtube or you can go and watch better ones than this youre welcome oh goodness these truly are horrific sorry about that does a hair tutorial and cant even do our own hairstyle I personally like to mess my french braids up I just think it looks more casual pull bits of hair out at the front widen the braids a little bit better anyway lets do the swishy blossie shocks or at least Ill try my best Music and now my friends Im going to leave these braids in for the rest of the day go to bed and then in the morning I will share with you the temp hairstyle its me Im back so its now the next day and this is what my french braids are looking like theyre a bit Messier obviously Ive slept on them so for the final hairstyle Im gonna take my braids out I like to call this the crinkled mermaid does it look pretty or has she just not brushed her hair so obviously first of all and taking out my braids but the thing you dont want to do is run your fingers through your hair too much you dont want to brush your hair after you do this because your hair is just going to turn into one big frizz ball Ive added a little bit of dry shampoo and then Im going to tie the top section of my hair up I do this because to be honest at the back of my head the hair at the root of my head isnt usually very curly so if I tie the top section up it kind of covers that and I think it looks really pretty especially from the back so those are my ten quick and easy hairstyles for long hair these are the ones that I personally tend to wear the most so I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope that some of you found it helpful if you did please do give it a big thumbs up and remember to subscribe to see

This video is about learning styles What kind of learner are you Oh yeah Im a visual person so I have to see things yeah Oh yeah same I think visual learner Visual I mean like I remember formulas like auditory I need to be like interacting with the material I like to learn by doing it myself Very handson Handson learner Handson So like if I have a model Id like to look at that and look it over Part of this video was sponsored by Google Search There is this idea in education that everyone has their own preferred way of learning their socalled learning style If information is presented in accordance with the learning style well then theyll learn better Now there are dozens of different learning style theories but the most common one identifies four main learning styles visual auditory readingwriting and kinesthetic or VARK for short Visual learners learn best from images demonstrations and pictures People may say things but I cant really take it in I just gotta see em act it out or write it or something Derek Auditory learners learn best from listening to an explanation Like in school I was always engaged in the lecture and that was usually good enough to pass a test Derek Readingwriting learners learn best from reading and writing Like I can get pretty much anything out of reading a textbook or something Derek And kinesthetic learners learn best by doing Physically interacting with the world Handson You have to touch things you have to play with things you know its a contact sport You have to do it yourself I want to try something with you a little experiment I want to show you 10 pictures of things and I dont want you to say anything while youre looking at them and at the end of the 10 you tell me how many you can remember Okay Okay Okay Okay Now learning styles make intuitive sense because we know everyone is different Some people have better spacial reasoning Others have better listening comprehension We know some people are better readers while others are good with their hands Its sort of very much fits with a broad strain of thought in the recent Western tradition is were all unique were all different And so you dont want to say like everybody learns the same way That sort of conflicts with our feelings about what it means to be human So doesnt it make sense that people should learn better in their own preferred learning style Well teachers certainly seem to think so A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and the Netherlands found that over 90 believed that individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style Instructor Just like every professor has a different style of teaching you have a different style of learning Instructor But when his teacher starts using visuals Johnathan finds it easier to focus and understand the material so he might be a visual learner Derek Can you tell me what that means to you Like what does it mean to be a visual learner To me it means that for me to learn something sometimes you need to draw it or I need to write it down or I need to see a picture or a movie For example science classes I get bored easily just listening and I think its more interesting for me to actually be able to do it Derek How do you know that youre a visual learner I dont I just assumed To take advantage of learning styles then teachers need to do two things First identify the learning style of each of their students And second teach each student in accordance with their learning style On the VARK website it says once you know about VARK its power to explain things will be a revelation But before you take an online learning styles quiz its a good idea to ask do learning styles even exist I mean do you have one And if youre taught in accordance with it would you learn better warm instrumental music Well you could test this by running a randomized control trial where first you would identify learners with at least two different learning styles say visual and auditory and then randomly assign learners to one of two educational presentations one visual one auditory So for half of the students the experience will match their learning style and for the other half it wont And then you give everyone the same test If the learning style hypothesis is correct the results should show better performance when the presentation matches the learning style than when theyre mismatched I tried a very unscientific version of this experiment on the street For some people I matched their learning style so I showed visual learners pictures of 10 items but for other visual learners I read out the items instead Bell penguin sun Okay Im maxed out Derek How many can you remember I dont know Hair knife duck heart butterfly Apple bicycle guitar There was a spider Did I say eye already Trumpet pear Pear Butterfly Duck Knife Boat Heart Knife Heart I couldnt tell you the rest thats all I got Derek Most people could remember only about five or six things Yeah yeah Six six is not bad All right Six Six out of 10 which is not bad right Oh all right yeah Thats a passing score Candle Oh Candle Everyone forgets the candle But a few could remember substantially more say eight or nine items Bug I dont know if I said bug Guitar bike eye bell spoon sun chair Im forgetting the last two Thats pretty good Eight is really good Oh cool Nine Nine out of 10 Nine very impressive But the reason didnt seem to be because the presentation matched their preferred learning style but because they employed a memory strategy So as you were showing I was making an order in my head So as I saw more I would just add it to the list and I was repeating the list as I was looking at them so I could just say it out loud Did you try a strategy while you were looking at those pictures Yeah yeah So I guess I tried creating a story cause its easier to remember a story than just individual objects So I tried to tie it all into one story This is all obviously anecdotal evidence but rigorous studies like the one I outlined have been conducted For example one looked at visualizers versus verbalizers instead of visual versus auditory learners The study was computerbased so first students learning styles were assessed using questions like would you rather read a paragraph or see a diagram describing an atom The researchers also provided some challenging explanations with two buttons visual help or verbal help The visual one played a short animation whereas the verbal help gave a written explanation From these measures combined the researchers categorized the students as either visualizers or verbalizers and then the students were randomly assigned to go through a textbased or picturebased lesson on electronics When a student hovered their mouse over key words in the lesson in the textbased group a definition and clarification came up But in the picture group an annotated diagram was shown instead And after the lesson the students did a test to assess their learning The students whose preferred learning style matched their instruction performed no better on the tests than those whose instruction was mismatched The researchers ran the test again with 61 noncollegeeducated adults and found exactly the same result But learning styles are a preference so how strongly do learners stick to their preference Well in a 2018 study during the first week of semester over 400 students at a university in Indiana completed the VARK questionnaire and they were classified according to their learning style Then at the end of the semester the same students completed a study strategy questionnaire So how did they actually study during the term Well an overwhelming majority of students used study strategies which were supposedly incompatible with their learning style and the minority of students who did did not perform significantly differently on the assessments in the course The visual auditory readingwriting kinesthetic or VARK model came about from Neil Fleming a school inspector in New Zealand Describing the origins of VARK he says I was puzzled when I observed excellent teachers who did not reach some learners and poor teachers who did I decided to try to solve this puzzle There are of course many reasons for what I observed But one topic that seemed to hold some magic some explanatory power was preferred modes of learning modal preferences And thus VARK was born There was no study that revealed students naturally cluster into four distinct groups Just some magic that might explain why some teachers can reach students while others cant But how can this be If we accept that some people are more skilled at interpreting and remembering certain kinds of stimuli than others like visual or auditory then why dont we see differences in learning or recall with different presentations Well its because what we actually want people to recall is not the precise nature of the images or the pitch or quality of the sound Its the meaning behind the presentations There are some tasks that obviously require the use of a particular modality Learning about music for example should have an auditory component Similarly learning about geography will involve looking at maps And some people will have greater aptitude to learn one task over another Someone with perfect pitch for example will be better able to recall certain tones in music Someone with excellent visualspatial reasoning will be better at learning the locations of countries on a map But the claim of learning style theories is that these preferences will be consistent across learning domains The person with perfect pitch should learn everything better auditorily but that is clearly not the case Most people will learn geography better with a map Review articles of learning styles consistently conclude there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist In a 2009 review the researchers note the contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is in our opinion striking and disturbing If classification of students learning styles has practical utility it remains to be demonstrated What were expecting is if your style was honored youre going to perform better than if you had some experience that conflicted with your style And this is where we dont see any support for the learning styles theory One of the reasons many people find learning styles so convincing is because they already believe it to be true For example they might already think that theyre a visual learner and then when a teacher shows them a diagram of say a bike pump and suddenly the concept clicks well they interpret this as evidence for their visual learning style You already believe that learning styles is right When you have an experience the first think you think is is that in some way consistent with learning styles And if it is you dont think further When in reality that diagram might just be a great diagram that would have helped anyone learn When we already believe the world to be a certain way then we interpret new experiences to fit with those beliefs whether they actually do or not So if learning styles dont improve learning then what does Well theres a large body of literature that supports the claim that everyone learns better with multimodal approaches where words and pictures are presented together rather than either words or pictures alone Now theres gonna be words as well as the picture Were gonna see if this is any better This is known as the multimedia effect and it explains in part at least why videos can be such powerful tools for learning when the narration complements the visuals Duck Duck Heart Heart Derek In my PhD research I found explicit discussion of misconceptions was essential in multimedia teaching for introductory physics How many is that Six Six okay thats good That is a whole 50 better Do you think that was easier Yeah yeah 100 100 Yeah with the words yeah Ultimately the most important thing for learning is not the way the information is presented but what is happening inside the learners head People learn best when theyre actively thinking about the material solving problems or imagining what happens if different variables change I talked about how and why we learn best in my video The Science of Thinking so check that out Now the truth is there are many evidencebased teaching methods that improve learning Learning styles is just not one of them And it is likely given the prevalence of the learning styles misconception that it actually makes learning worse I mean learning styles give teachers unnecessary things to worry about and they make some students reluctant to engage with certain types of instruction And all the time and money spent on learning styles and related training could be better spent on interventions that actually improve learning You are not a visual learner nor an auditory learner nor a kinesthetic learner or more accurately you are all these kinds of learner in one The best learning experiences are those that involve multiple different ways of understanding the same thing And best of all this strategy works not just for one subset of people but for everyone radio tuner chirping This part of the video was sponsored by Google Search Now there are lots of topics out there that are controversial like learning styles for example Most people believe learning styles are a thing whereas educational researchers find no robust evidence for them And if you search for learning styles youll get lots of sites with resources and quizzes But if you search for learning styles debunked well then youll find articles about how there is very little evidence for the learning styles hypothesis I think one of the most common traps people fall into is only searching for information that confirms what they already believe A common mistake is putting the answer youre looking for right in the search query A better idea is to try another search adding debunked or false at the end and see what comes up And Google makes it easy to get more detail about the source of the information Just click the three dots next to any search result and then you can judge for yourself whether the information is trustworthy and if you want to visit the site A Google Search is meant to surface the most relevant information for your query But its up to you to formulate that query try a few different searches and assess whether the information is reliable And the whole point of Veritasium is to get to the truth So Im excited to encourage everyone to think more critically about how we get information I want to thank Google for sponsoring this part of the

today were going to be talking about basic editing and adobe audition so Ive got audition opened up right now and I am in this simple editing workspace and you can navigate to that if you go up here to the window menu and come down here to the workspaces you can see that Im in a simple editing workspace and this is just a nice simple editing interface for doing some simple and its like were going to be talking about today so hi its a bunch of stuff that you may not be using while youre working today so its nice and handy to kind of hide all those extraneous things so we are in the simple editing workspace Im going to go up here into the file pane up here Im gonna double click as I want to bring in the audio clip that were gonna work with today so Im just gonna double click in this space up here it opens up the Open File dialog and I can navigate to where I have that file saved and its right here on the desktop and it is were gonna be talking about how to boil water today I had a coworker Liz record some audio for us and she talked about her tips and tricks for how to boil water so were gonna mess with that so Im gonna click on that and hit open so it opens up here in the Adobe Audition interface and you can see we went for about a little over three minutes talking about this so were gonna trim that down were also gonna look for some spaces where we had some mistakes that we had to start up again and and were going to snip those out were also going to talk about how to raise audio levels of the entire clip as well as going in and doing some target audio level raising and lowering so right off the bat when I look at this waveform I can see its a little on the low side right here right off the bat I remember that we had a Liz laughs right at this point so were not going to use that as to judge the whole waveform but I can kind of see that overall its hitting at about minus 15 on the vu meters over here on the on this side of the screen so Im going to raise the entire overall level of the clip first and to do that we have this little dialog box up here and if I just go ahead and click and hold where it says plus zero I can actually raise or lower the entire level of the clip and Im just gonna I kind of use 12 DB as kind of my rough kind of gauge as to how I want the overall level of the clip to be so Im gonna look and see see those little grassy Peaks there Im gonna kind of raise them so I have a good number of them over of minus 12 and Im gonna release it right there and I can click off of it so now Ive got some good grassy Peaks coming up here over 12 thats great so overall weve got a good level for the clip so now lets talk about how we can go in and start snipping out the stuff that we dont need right off the bat if I move the playhead up here click and hold on the playhead and drag it all the way to the beginning of the clip I can hit the spacebar hit the spacebar on my keyboard to play and I can hear this is just the introductory stuff of us getting started we dont need this in the final recording so Im gonna find a place where where it is actually I hit the spacebar again right there to stop the playback Im gonna find the space where we actually do start and want to pick up the recording of Liz Im hit the spacebar again there is another way to navigate and that is if I use the JK and L keys on my keyboard I can actually hit the L button and it plays forward at one times normal speed if I tap it again then it plays back at 200 percent normal speed and if I want to stop like I just did I hit the K key so the JKL ll will move you forward tap it again itll move you forward 200 percent and on the other side of that if you have the J key itll take you backwards 100 reverse speed hit it again and itll boost that up to 200 reverse speed so you can kind of use that so Im gonna kind of speed through the clip till we find the actual start of this okay lets see what Im saying in here choose a pot with a lid okay so I just heard lets start right there Im gonna hit the J key you gotta go backwards and I can also use the right and left arrow keys on my keyboard just to kind of find that sweet spot between where she had said okay and then she started speaking so Im gonna zoom up on this area just to get a better look at it on my keyboard if I use the plus keys on my keyboard I can actually zoom in to that little area right there and then using my cursor here Im gonna click and hold on this spot and then Im gonna drag still holding the mouse button down Im gonna drag all the way back to the beginning and highlight that area thats the part we dont need thats the introductory part where we were just getting started Ive got that selected Im gonna hit the Delete key on my keyboard and voila it disappears and now when I hit the spacebar on my keyboard theres Liz and she could start up heat inside the pot making the water boil faster a large pot will take longer to boil but the shape does not make a noticeable difference Anna cold tap water hot tap water can pick up blood from I think okay so there was a mistake there where she kind of strayed a little bit off the script so were gonna go ahead and find where she picks it up again hot tap water can pick up lead from so she started right in here saying hot tap water again right there so we want to pick it up from right from that spot right there so Im gonna find the spot where she said that line right there so Im gonna select all of that right up until she said started saying hot tap water again Ive got that little part selected right there I could preview that and just make sure thats the part I want to snip out while its selected if I hit the spacebar hot tap water can pick up blood from okay try that again hot chocolate and itll loop that little section right there so we can confirm yes this is the part we want to delete so with it selected Im going to hit delete and you see that it snip that part out and also rippled everything back forward took out that space that we delete it and I can play that through to make sure hot tap water can pick up lead from your water pipes and its not recommended for drinking or cooking Oh hot tap water well we did that again too so lets go ahead and do the same thing we just did Im gonna go ahead and kind of highlight the part we wanted to lead just like that again I could hit the spacebar to confirm thats the part we wanted to lead but I know thats what we want to get rid of so with it highlighted Im gonna hit delete and its gone and then with them picking up again and a cold tap water hot tap water can pick up lead from your water pipes and is not recommended for drinking or cooking start with cold tap water instead dont fill it up all the way a full pot can splash you as it boils and youll need space to add the food if youre cooking dont believe the myth cold water does not boil faster than hot water okay I know this is riveting stuff but youre learning how to boil water correctly now okay theres another another place where we decided to redo that line its the safe option above that okay its the safe option but it will take a bit longer so shes picks it up right there with its the safe option and Im just gonna confirm were were gonna pick it up take what part were to take out its the safe right there we want to take that part out so were gonna come in here right to that point its the safe option but it will take a bit longer okay just confirming that is what we want to take out so Im gonna hit the Delete key and its out of there so faster then hot water its the safe now theres a little breath in there you kind of heard that little breath again you can zoom up and zoom back from your waveform by hitting the plus and minus keys so if I want to you know get in there to do some really precise editing Im gonna hit the plus button a couple of times get really close to that and Im gonna highlight that little breath there and Im gonna delete it so that it plays through nice and clean well water does not boil faster than hot water its the safe option above that oh its the seep so this is kind of the process you go through you listen you highlight the areas you want to snip out and you delete them its the safe option but it will take a bit longer add salt you can even take out a little extra pauses when you dont feel like you need that extra pause in there so Im gonna highlight that little pause and remove it add salt for flavor which is optional salt has almost and Im hitting the minus button on my keyboard to zoom back out again you dont have to make it seawater added only to flavor the food especially pasta which will observe the salts along with the water you might notice a bunch of bubbles rise up as soon as you put the salt in Im gonna do that you might note theres a little spot right there where she picked it up again so lets take that highlight that little area and delete you might notice a bunch of bubbles rise up as soon as you put the salt in its a fun effect but it doesnt change to the temperature thats so add salt when boiling eggs lets take that little part out pink add salt when boiling eggs if the shell cracks the salt will help the egg whites a little okay doing that one thank you if the shell cracks if the shell so I just confirming that we want to take all of this section out of here there we go highlight it and delete it if the shell cracks the salt will help the egg white solidify plugging the hole oh theres a page turn where she turned to the second page lets get rid of that too lets highlight that and delete it place the pot over high heat place the pot on the stove and turn the burner underneath it to high cover the pot with a lid to help the water boil a little faster okay theres the end so Im gonna go ahead and highlight the end right here to get rid of that little extra dialog right there and delete it so now I can zoom all the way back up by hitting the minus key on my keyboard and theres our file so weve done the edits now weve done our selective edits by just highlighting those areas and deleting them to shorten it all up so now lets get in here and do a little bit of surgical volume work here because you can kind of see we do have those nice grassy Peaks going above 12 but there are some areas that look a little low and Im just going to highlight a few of them like this little area right in here where you can kind of see according to the waveform her voice drops down a little bit lets zoom in on that a little bit place my playhead over that spot Im gonna hit the plus button a couple of times on my keyboard so if I want to raise the overall volume of this little section Im going to highlight this little bit of it right there and with it highlighted I can actually go up to this little volume dialogue box and youll see that I can raise just that little area either up or down so if you have something like a cough or something like that that you want to take down you can use this technique to you can actually lower the volume of something a cough or a laughs or something like that and lets see how that sounds now both pot can splash you as it boils and youll need space to add the food if youre cooking so you can use this method to just kind of surgically go in and raise or lower the volume of certain sections just by highlighting them and then using the dialogue box to kind of do a little bit of a little bit of work on those until it all sounds good its the safe option but it will take a bit longer yes this is looking really good I could go through here and do some more work on it again just surgically doing that work but I think Im gonna stop here for now it looks pretty good overall theres a lot more work I could do on this but this just gives you a sense of how to do some very basic editing and adobe audition and how to do some volume work on this there is also a way that you could actually fade up and fade down if this was music or something like that on the clip itself you see these little buttons up here and theyre in the corners on both sides this actually allows you to do a fade up or a fade out and you can kind of see how it effects effects your waveform there we dont need to do that for this clip but you might have some need for it if you were adding in some music or a sound effect or something like that you could use this technique so weve done our editing weve done our audio work so now we can just do a save as and save this is something new I dont want to overwrite the original file because I may want to go back and change my mind and redo some work so Im going to change the name from raw now to final and just save it right back to my desktop there and its going to save and were done thank you for watching;hit the spacebar to start and stop playback tap the K key to pause tap the right and left arrow keys to go forward or reverse 1 frame at a time click and hold

and i say monday you are for playing cards only i dont review magic on monday monday is for decks monday is for playing cards and today were looking at bicycle imperial all right so the bicycle imperial playing cards um an homage to imperial bicycles this also says the blue edition so i think when you say that it implies theres other colors right very vintage looking very old school right air cushion made in usa on one side as the other bottom only a little bit of ad copy about united states playing card company you got a original tux seal there and the back design of the cards and thats everything lets crack it open and look inside look at that back design absolutely beautiful you got a nice medium sized poker border there top and bottom mirrored image it says imperial you get the bicycle there very vintagey almost a currency style look right currency style look to that back design this deck is going to be perfect for everything you need cards for whether it be games or magic or flourishing with this deck youll get two gaff cards one is a double backer and one is a blank face card if you would like to know what to do with cards like this i would recommend you pick up the encyclopedia of card magic also with these cards youll get two identical jokers it is a its a its a clown its kind of a kind of a childlike clown leaning against a tall wheeled bicycle says joker on the top and bottom the clown is wearing a fun little hat yep your ace of spades is that same currency style vintage look you also have an original pip and indice in each corner it says ace of spades and made in the usa and your other three aces look the same they both follow suit and of course the reds are red and theyre nice and large very beautiful looking cards going through the face cards pips and indices youre going to see original pips and indices standard layout right blacks are kind of a uh like a gunmetal gray you can barely see it against this camera reds of course are red lets see if i can find uh theres a diamond for you and the clubs are right there with this deck all the court cards are original and really they look like they were taken from photographs like they look like theyre taken from real pictures so it makes me wonder like who these people were or at least who the inspiration for them was but um theyre absolutely beautiful never seen anything like this so very very very cool looking but thats just what the deck looks like you also want to know how these cards feel and how the cards handle of course theyre made by bicycle who pretty much makes the best cards on the planet right well well say the universe right why not best cards in the universe uh the other thing i can do is i can measure them and weigh them compare them against other decks in my collection so 10 cards in the caliper come to 287 287 is just us just a smidge above middle just a smidge above middle so gonna feel like maybe a deck of cards youd buy right off the peg hook at your favorite grocery store but a little crispier a little snappier a little more rigid but not much and thats everything i can say about the bicycle imperial playing cards well see if they release

so sean thanks very much for joining us um can you just explain to those watching what your role is please yeah my name is sean and im head of sport at united learning we are a multiacademy trust which incorporates about 80 schools around the country primary schools secondary schools and about 1213 independent schools as well and my job is to support all the heads of pe and director of sport in those schools to do the best of possibly they can in and through pe and sport fantastic so i guess that almost links nicely into the first question whats whats on the minds of those stuff that you talk about and i know that we quite often rugby clubs will go in and theyll talk about rugby being the main drive but whats sort of the best way for rugby clubs to engage with directors for sport pe stuff do you think definitely to think more about a holistic contribution to a childs education so that yes its definitely kind of rugby specific content and skills and experience which is really welcome and valued by schools but that needs to fit in within the bigger picture of what schools ambitions are for their young people particularly where we are at the moment im speaking in september 2021 and need to upskill young people again with physical competencies with um elements of physical fitness and endurance and stamina but really that love of being physically physically active and for it to become a habit so if a rope a club coming into school can help in the physical activity but also through rugby learning skills and competencies the soft skills and noncognitive skills as well as the technical skills then they would be making a really good contribution to the life of the school fantastic and do you think that rugby clubs need to do anything to tailor their offer to enable them to do that i think it would be helpful if rugby clubs certainly didnt present themselves as being all about the 15 aside game and about rugby being a support for all about rugby being able to be accessed more accessible by all young people and also a game that is about handling running and invasion rather than too much emphasis on the contact aspect of the game which is right for some people and some young people get an awful lot from that and but in the main to capture the joy of physical activity and of playing sports with friends for fun and rugby can do a lot better than simply focus on the 15 side game it might be fantastic are there other things that rugby clubs and rugby can do to help support some of the wider school young leaders staff sort of other other sort of benefits you would associate from a link yes definitely and from our experience where it works really well is to embed young leaders as just as your example there and but also if any of the people that are key to that rugby club and that might be a coach or an official in some way but those link people with the school if they are able to offer something additional like some mentoring like sitting in a classroom with a couple of students that that would be beneficial to just being that beyond a rugby coach or being beyond um a rugby club official to be that person to who for whom a young person can depend on and can turn to can be another nonteaching responsible adult can be really valuable weve seen that happen with other activities that we use strategically in a few of our schools to just be seen as a person of a technical coaching deliverer i think is potentially missing a trick with some of the highly skilled people that youve got in the rugby clubs around the country fantastic and thinking across some of the schools that you work with what are the minimum standards they would be expecting from some of those rugby coaches that might go in and deliver uh curriculum extracurricular activity usually at ngb level two and it could be level one depending on whether that is direct coaching or kind of peer coaching if you like but normally it would be a level two most schools will ask people to complete a dbs anyway so it doesnt matter if youve got one that would be unique to that setting school would ask you to do their own anyway um but its about the quality of the person as well so even if you have those qualifications and that paperwork its about your qualities as an individual and your approach to young people thats as important as any qualifications you may have so sean whats one of the barriers or some of the barriers youve noticed to coaches working in schools the biggest barrier usually is the time of day and whilst having an additional person during school day can be helpful and predominantly where schools benefit most from getting some support from community coaches is in the extracurricular setting so that kind of time between three oclock and five oclock perhaps um and part of the problem of course is that many people are doing their own work in those times so its been a perennial challenge to because coaching unless youre a professional coach and its your fulltime job its really challenging to get support from community clubs in that three to five pm window so anything that community clubs can do to support schools in that particular time frame i think would be a real asset to any school provision fantastic and last question from us sean is remember youve mentioned before that youve started as a sort of a teacher within the pe setting know that staff are really busy especially at the moment what tips have you got for rugby clubs who are trying to get hold of a member of a pe department to help form a link to speak to them initially to find out whats the best way of communicating with them so dont assume that email is always best some pe teachers will find little time during the course of the week to get on email it might be that they are happy and would prefer to have a text message or to set up a whatsapp link or whatever so i guess engage with them in the first instance by letting them know what you can offer and saying you know and asking the question whats the best way of of kim touch because youre right theyre extremely busy but also i dont think theres a one size answer to that question that would suit every p teach around the country speak to them find out what works best for them and take it from there;Intro Best ways for clubs to engage with staff in school Do clubs need to do anything to tailor their offer What can clubs do to help support some of the staff Minimum standards schools expect from rugby club coaches coming in to deliver sessions What are the barriers you might come up against with coaches coming into schools Making contact with a member of the staff in school;3

i think this may be the most distracting backdrop ive ever put up in a video youre gonna feel sick just watching this and not in the usual way hey guys im tom with techchap and this isnt all about gaming even though ive got the ps5 and the series x hooked up at the moment this is about what is the best tv rather than individual models i want to give you some of my top tips for how to choose the right one for you because there is about a million things to think about and it can all get a bit overwhelming but if you guys do enjoy the video and find it useful which hopefully you do then a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated okay so tip number one and thats two but when is the best time to buy a new tv well the answer is actually right now well for me at least as im filming this in midnovember because weve got black friday and cyber monday coming up Applause as you would expect these are the best times to get big discounts on the latest models reason being most new tvs are announced in january at the big ces conference in vegas and then usually released between march and april every year which is when youre pretty much guaranteed to be paying sticker price but give it five or six months after launch and youll probably see a good 20 to 30 off although this year maybe pair back a little bit as we still have this ongoing chip supply shortage crisis thing uh so supply is still out strip no all the way around so demand is still outstripping supply but another good way to save money and leading into tip number two very nicely is look beyond the regular big brands because the likes of tcl and high sense are putting out some great tvs these days which are often pretty spectacular value for money tip number three and size matters im not gonna make a joke i always make a joke im not gonna do it this time this is a 55inch this is a 65inch although slightly awkwardly theyre on different height tv stands but i love a big tv its more immersive and it helps your eyes perceive more detail especially as were upgrading to 4k and maybe even 8k screens and in my experience youre less likely to regret buying a tv thats just a little bit too big than going for one thats maybe a bit smaller than youd like i think the sweet spot is either a 55 or a 65 inch 4k tv at least here in the uk where we have really small houses but the thing is when you go above 65 into your 70s and your 80s things often get a lot more expensive i still wouldnt bother with 8k though its diminishing returns its very expensive but if you do want to go for one i would suggest at least 75 inches so you can see the difference this next tip is for when you actually already have your tv and that is to change the settings it can make such a difference just playing around with it for a few minutes because a number of people i know who buy their fancy new tv and just you know use out the box settings which to be fair arent as terrible as they often used to be in the past but youre going to want to turn off that motion smoothing unless youre watching sports so youre not going to get that soap operalike effect and god forbid if they set it up in store mode picking one of the presets is fine and newer tvs often remember your choice depending on the app or the input youre using but if youve got one of these options then use game mode for consoles and then for movies and tv any kind of expert or filmmaker mode is your best bet as these tend toward more natural tones in line supposedly with what the original filmmakers wanted my next tip is actually pretty simple and maybe unless youve got one of these sky glass tvs because the builtin speakers are incredible actually get a soundbar or a separate speaker system anything because if youre going to spend a ton of money on a new tv with fantastic picture quality you want the sound to match to be fair some pricier tvs do have better quality and bassier speakers and attempt a bit of surround sound but i really would suggest getting a good sound bar and plenty of speakers and sound bars allow you to connect to the tv via an arc or an earc enabled hdmi port which is so much more convenient because you can then use your tv remote to control your sound but i think my personal favorite right now is this the sonos arc its a little bit pricey but i think its incredible so for this video lg actually very kindly offered to sponsor the little integration ad break part in the middle which were gonna go into now and that is all about a tv which isnt actually not in here it is over there in my living room so come with me so this is the 77 inch lg g1 and quite honestly i will take any opportunity i can to show off this tv it is incredible the g1 aka the gallery design tv not only has a unique flush wall mount so it sits right up against your wall although right now ive got a nice gradient light strip behind it but this along with the z1 series have lgs next generation oled evo technology which combines the alpha 9 gen 4 ai processor 4k new improved materials and an even brighter screen and of course being an oled we have the cell flip pixels so we get that infinite contrast no haloing in just the perfect black so you cant get on a normal led lcd so as you would expect picture quality on this is top notch the processor intelligently upscales content to 4k and also optimizes both the picture and the sound quality we also get dolby vision iq and dolby ammo support for a proper cinematic experience and motion pro helps reduce motion blur i actually reviewed this a few months ago and at the time i called it the best gaming tv you can buy and i stand by that even now 4k 120 fps hdmi 21 gsync and freesync as well as super fast response times and low input lag which is actually really important and this game optimizer menu gives you all the game specific functions in one place so check out lgs huge range of oled tvs including this oled evo g1 theres some great black friday deals and ill leave a link in the description below okay were back lets talk about tip number what are we on tip number six picture quality in my experience the biggest determiner of picture quality is how deep the blacks can get which is basically the contrast ratio and also the brightness measured in nips and this is even more important when it comes to hdr movies and games in fact id argue that good hdr especially in content with dolby vision or hdr 10 plus is one of the biggest upgrades tvs have had in the last decade although the good news is that all 4k tvs do at least support some basic hdr formats but if you can try and get a tv that supports dolby vision hdr which most do these days except well frustratingly most samsung tvs but dobby vision is one of the most common and most popular hdr formats all this brings me to tip number seven seven um ive completely lost my train of thought now where are we all this brings me to the next question which tv technology what panel type is best and to keep things simple youve got your basic led lcd tvs which have generally quite poor contrast rubbish viewing angles but are nice and cheap the next tier up is a bit more convoluted youve got your quantum dots your nano cells and even mini led tvs these are more expensive but usually with higher brightness better contrast and more dimming zones on the backlight so you get less blooming and more accurate colors but at the top its still pretty much a two horse race between oled and qled we do have some very exciting new technologies coming soon like micro led from samsung but thats ridiculously expensive and probably five years off from actually being in your living room as i mentioned in the ad break with an oled each pixel can turn itself on and off so you have near enough infinite contrast super inky blacks almost no blooming or light bleed and incredible viewing angles the only real compromise with oled is it cant match the brightness of a good qled with the best ones from samsung but with each generation they do get better if i had to take one to a desert island well actually id probably go with the qlead because the higher brightness would help drown out the sun which is presumably overhead and also assuming ive got power and a signal you cant go wrong with either but for my money assuming you can maybe control the lighting in your living room you even got a super bright window behind you or something i would go oled both technologies still come at a premium though although something like this lg 55inch c1 which is actually my tv of the year now you can get for less than 1200 pounds back to gaming though because the big reason a lot of people want to buy a new tv is to pair it with their shiny new ps5 or xbox series x and while you can play your games on any tv from the last you know 10 15 years anything with an hdmi port near enough there are some pretty big benefits to paying a little bit more and getting a new tv with some gaming features to get the best experience look for at least one hdmi 21 port that makes it a lot more future proof but also you want support for 120 hertz often called vrr or variable refresh rate also if possible look out for freesync and or gsync to smooth out your gameplay and reduce screen tearing and also keep a lookout for a llm or auto low latency mode which the tv will switch to when it detects a console input and that helps turn off all the background processing rubbish and gives you the best response time the problem is though hdmi 21 tvs which are fantastic futureproof things that got very bright all of a sudden are very expensive and really theres only a handful of games that support 4k at 120fps which that unlocks there are a bunch of other benefits to 21 which well i could spend a whole video talking about but in terms of real world gaming hdmi 20 which you have on every tv really is absolutely fine you can still get 120 fps if your tv supports it but just at a lower resolution and having low response times and a good picture quality is far more important tip number nine and all new tvs are smart tvs which basically means you can connect it to the internet and then theyll have the usual range of streaming apps although not all tvs have all the apps thats worth checking im sure you guys already know this but if you do have an older nonsmart tv then get a roku stick or an amazon fire 4k or google chromecast because they are incredibly cheap ways of getting access to streaming apps without buying a whole new tv and finally tip number 10 read reviews not spec sheets for example this sky glass tv which i reviewed recently is technically a quantum dot mini led which sounds great but in reality the brightness peaks at around 600 nits which is pretty average plus its only 60 hertz with no real gaming features its not bad for the price but as i say just reading the specs doesnt necessarily give you an idea of what the picture quality is actually like so its worth reading or watching a few reviews of the tv youre thinking about first to get past all that marketing jargon but what about you what tv are you using at the moment and also are you thinking about upgrading to a new one anytime soon and if so what would you go for let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys i do hope you

hi guys its judgement Ill be doing a testator and Im gonna show you guys all of my tattoos that I currently have and this has been Im pretty highly requested video so I thought I would film it today so lets just get right into it oh so its snowing right now so its so pretty and Im so happy I dont have class today doing theyll chronological order Im just gonna start with the first tattooed I see so so far I have 10 tattoos but Im definitely gonna be getting more some of my tattoos were done by myself using the stick and poke method and others were done by actual tattoo artists the first tattoo that Im gonna be talking about is the one online its an image of a lily I got for my grandma because its her favorite flower are lilies and I draw for her cuz shes been here for me ever since I was born and shes always taking care of me so I just want to get something to honor her and I looked through lily designs on Pinterest and I found one that I really liked but I changed it up a bit and I bought two tattoo artists oh so I really like to get like flower tattoos I dont really care if they have meaning or not and I dont know I just want to be a garden you know next I have my finger tats these have no meaning honestly I just wanted some stars on my fingers because they look cute no and I got these done by my friend high on an art class um I got this done back in senior year I believe she was testing out a tattoo gun cuz she was using that for one for projects and I was like hey can you talk to me yes sure so I was basically her like guinea pig cuz she never really did it on anybody else youre fading right now but I dont really mind sure she did the stars on my index finger but for my middle finger I stick and poked a star too to match my index finger it was very fun we kept doing it when the teacher wasnt working next we have my upper arm tattoo so the tattoo on my upper arm is basically just a leaf I did it by myself using stick and poke but then I had my tattoo artist we did my ribs have to go over it again so now its like much darker than always before when there was a stick in the Polk tattoo again is a leaf because I want to be a garden too many tattoos are great if they have a mean but I dont really think thats that important like having the mean is great but if it was spontaneous thats really great if you want to look pretty on your body thats also great so since I mentioned my rib tattoo were gonna talk about that one this is the biggest tattooed I have on my body its under my boobies and I really really really love it I got done by tattoo artist whos also an art student at another art show in New York right now and she used to be a tattoo artist and the tattoo shop in Korea thats where she trained and I asked her to design something for me and its so pretty I love it so this rib tattoo is an image of two custom themes enter time with each other and I got this one because theres a birth month flower for the month of November and thats when I was born and I also got them because my dog is a shitzu and in Chinese cities are known for having a Chi Holland which means Christian theme face cuz their head shapes are super late little oh and yeah thats why I got them I um got them cuz I just thought Christian themes are really pretty and theyre really delicate and theyre really complicated thats I feel like thats trying to me I got them in red and green because I wanted red tattoo and my tattoo artist suggested dark green leaves instead of black leaves so I just took her suggestion and she spent like four hours five hours on it but Im really really really happy with the outcome the color has faded a bit but Im probably just gonna get like touched up nice tea or something I like the look of faith tattoos I never some people dont but I really like it maybe not to the tattoo under my right collarbone its an image of my constellation the Scorpio zodiac I got an image of the constellation off from Google and then I added like my own low stars and dots to it and then I just gave it to a tattoo artist to do for me and I really like it and it looks really good when I wear like should start review like Mike this area of my body now going to my right shoulder area I have a tattoo of a cupid okay this one was super spontaneous basically the story is that Vicki and I went to get boba guys and Hatton like a few months ago and then we dont really have anything to do but we didnt want to go back you know so I was like shes like a tattoo and she said yeah like as in a joking way cuz she didnt think I was actually gonna get one but then I was like you know what Im just gonna get one I dont care I want to keep it tattoo it anyway so now I got that and some like tattoo shop and East Village I think I feel like a lot of people have this tattoo no cuz its a really popular image that I found off the internet and I feel like I dont know I dont really regret it but I do feel like I should have designing my own Cupid or like at least in my own style but I also really like this style too so I dont really have much to say to tattoo on the back of my upper right arm is of orchids and I got this one for my mom because in Chinese her name is LAN which also means blue but oh she means orchid flower and also she really loves for kids I got the architect a denim red and black because as I said before I really like the look of red tattoos and I just wanted to get something red incorporated it with it this tattoo I got along with my constellation and my Lily tattoo from the same tattoo shop in Brooklyn then on my right Laura in their arm area I have another tattooed this one wears a stick and poke that I did by myself and its basically an abstract image um I designed that myself I really liked how it looked it doesnt really have any meaning to it I just thought its cute so I just do it myself okay so thats it for my upper body tattoos now were gonna move to the lower body area okay thats not so wrong so going to the tattoo on my thigh this one I did two years ago I believe back in high school its a stick and poke tattoo its an image of a flower because I want to be a garden like Ive said before I dont know where I found this image I cant remember how where I got this or where I drew this basically yeah its a flower it doesnt have any meaning I thought would look cute if I wore shorts in the summer and I was like okay whatever I was gonna do it and then to my last tattoo my tenth tattoo is the one on my ankle this is my first stick and poke that I did it used to be a heart I did two and a half years ago back in junior I believe and it used to be a heart because I was trying not sticking book for the first time and I used a sewing needle for this one and in that youre not too good it was very dotty and very scabby but I was like whatever so youre later in senior year I bought a cool tattoo Nino its an actual tattoo ink and then I went over to heart and I turned it into a flower its really cute sometimes I forget stare but yeah this one holds a lot of memories because there was my first stick and poke basically so about pain tolerance I know everyone has a different low of pain tolerance and I think mine is pretty decently high and Im just gonna list them off as to how much they hurt my finger tight shoes hurt quite a lot because there are a lot of nerves up there so I would give it like a 7 out of 10 I guess it went by really quickly and then the lily on my arm I would give it a 3 out of 10 to 2 3 out of 10 cuz honestly it really did not hurt the leaf on my left shoulder I would give it like it went out 10 cuz I felt no pain dear at all and then the collarbone oh my god this would hurt a lot I did not think it would hurt this much I was honestly really surprised I give this one like a 9 out of 10 but the good thing is he went pretty quickly so keep it on my right outer shoulder did not hurt I would give it a 1 out 10 cuz I really didnt feel anything however for the orchids on the back of my arm this visual is painful I would give it like a 9 out of 10 and OSHA I took quite a while to do which is why I feel like it made the pain worse it wasnt like really sharp pain it was just like tenderness tender pain if you get what I mean the abstract design tattooed I did by myself I would give it a like a 3 4 out of 10 it hurt a little when I did it but honestly always it too bad my rib tattoo I thought my rib tattoo would be the most painful of all my tattoos I have but honestly I dont think it was I would give it like a 7 out of 10 and its only da high because it took like four or five hours and then the tattoo on my thigh I would give it a 1 out of 10 and I her I really didnt feel anything and also since there was a stick and poke the tattoo neo didnt go as deep as it would have gone for an actual tattoo good the ankle tattooed I have I would give it also a 12 10 cuz yet I didnt her out all for me take over all my tattoos so thats basically it for all my tattoos and everything I have to share about them Im thinking about getting two new tattoos Ive been thinking about getting dragged in tattoos dont worry I havent thought much about it and I also want to get a shoulder tattoo from here around this area and I want to go towards my back but the thing is I know its gonna be really painful so I Im not sure about that yet still thinking about it and I still have to save up for it anyways yeah thats my to current tattoo plans but I have who knows maybe Ill get them a few months or maybe Ill get them in a few years but yeah thats basically it my tattoo tour and I hope that you guys enjoyed watching this video if you guys have any comments or concerns please comment them down below Ill try to answer all of them and stay tuned for a next video bye;Finger Tats Upper Arm Tattoo Rib Tattoo Tattoo on My Thigh Stick and Poke Tattoo Pain Tolerance Collarbone;2

of what youre gonna get so youre gonna get a beautiful sunrise its about 708 right now sunrise here is epic amazing so ill just show you a little bit of this and like i said some of the amenities so this is their hangout area in front of the ocean its kind of a rocky um sand like grid then you get some cabanas theres plenty area seems like enough room for everyone here which is pretty awesome sunrise is coming up while were waiting for the sunrise im going to show you some of the other places so right here is the tides beach bar and grill they serve food until 10 oclock delicious drinks drinks are about id say over 10 maybe 14 each 15 we have a lot of seating area we never really had a problem getting table and it was busy then you have your fishing pier where if you do any water activities here they do pick you up right here and you can fish off the stock also the pier is closed from dusk at dusk and opens that don wow look at that okay lets keep going then you got your beach area its a small beach area but you have a little beach area so im gonna get some sand again its kind of like a rocky gritty sand almost broken up shelves and stuff now this its been pretty windy last two days so thats why its pretty im sure they clean it up im sure they do its gorgeous Music heres the pier its our private pier for this resort or doc i guess youd say not appear necessarily and heres some of the ocean front rooms right here theres not that many i would say well thats like one two three four five six ocean front rooms and there are some light fish some small needle fish and stuff at the end of the stock here then you can rent a little sail catamaran type thing over here for if you stay here you can rent a canoe kayak i guess and paddle boards and bikes for one hour for free per day after one hour you have to pay for them so you get one hour a day and you have a basketball hoop which i think is pretty awesome right on the beach here so thats pretty epic we did play a little bit just gorgeous its just gorgeous then if you have enough people to have volleyball i havent really seen anybody play everybodys pretty relaxed here they have cornhole sandbags however you want to call it this is the rental booth where you can get snorkeling trips sandbar swim eco tours sunset cruises you can order all that stuff theres a lot of places to do that and the bicycles they do have smaller bikes mediumsized bikes for id say like nine to 11 year olds and fullsize bikes lots of them i wouldnt say theyre gonna run out either and you can rent these catamarans its pretty awesome bathroom heres the oceanfront rooms i guess youd say which theres very minimal of them wow then they have the splash pad here and all other rooms kind of go down that way i guess theres a couple more oceanfronts i think i dont know if they consider motion fun or not they have shuffleboard and ping pong so we did play a little ping pong cant find any balls now though they blow away pretty easy in the wind if its windy they do have a fine dining restaurant its called elements im not going to go over there and show you that its pretty expensive and you dont get that big of portions but i bet you its pretty good um the food at tides bar here by the beach its all right its a little expensive too but thats what you get at the resort id say its like i think 18 for a cheeseburger maybe 16 um its all right though so we had some fish tacos the wings were good so i recommend checking some of that stuff of course they have a destination sign of how many miles it takes to get places lets see here is this place open yet i hope so okay here we go ill show you some of the pool areas here guitar tied bar and grill not sure when it opens theres the the pool water here is pretty warm its actually pretty nice so i like that um we did use this pool a lot thats for sure and then theres you know plenty of seating actually heres the kiddie pool which we both used a lot too its got like that slow beach entrance on both sides here and they got a fairly good sized hot tub over here it was hot which it was already 85 and sunny out so you didnt want to be in here too much but still pretty nice then if youre gonna stay here and not get a beachfront room i recommend you get one of these rooms i think the beautiful sunrise and then our room is right here right out of the pool the pool is right here beach is behind us and our room is right here 414 and then every hotel room has these like entranceway or uh patio fronts with a screenedin area which is pretty awesome i really love that so there we are 414 this is the 410 building i guess it looks like okay 4 11 4 12 4 13 14 15 16 and then were able to park right here i guess most places have a parking fairly close and then whats awesome is were just so close to the beach and the pool some of the other rooms are tucked pretty far back in here ill walk in there a little bit so a lot of these rooms are its called the garden view so youre getting a view of the garden so like heres the room tucked in here a little bit they got their patio screened in area kind of like that but the garden here is amazing it actually makes me think im in the tropics because its so colorful good plants its kind of amazing and then it kind of walks all the way back down to the front office here so you can be you know a block away from your the pool depending on where you get your room and more but this garden view is amazing and they keep it really clean too so as we keep walking towards the lobby again youre going to get your typical patio chairs screening area in pretty much every single room and these are all the garden view we have a garden view room also but were lucky enough i requested called a few days in advance and asked to be as close to the pool as we possibly could and they made it happen this resort is pretty dang clean actually ill show you the inside of our room in a minute so this is the lobby the office its about as far away from the pool as you can be in the ocean still pretty nice though oh shes sweeping after walking with my sandy feet good morning i have to get the bun out there and were right to where you check in so when you pull in you go through security at that booth you park here and go check in its gorgeous here though very nice resort theres a security booth right here so youre supposed to stop for security before you even come in here Applause pretty nice and we stayed here for three nights over new years eve 2001 to 2022 uh some of these plants they have here are amazing the aloe plants the biggest one ive ever seen and i have to say it was busy but i guess its like the busiest time of year maybe just for my reminder it was negative 20 at home with no wind chill so and then heres the thing that they dont tell you these are the shuttles the golf carts enclosed they got doors they got windows and theyll bring you 15 miles away so thatd be like the florida keys brewing company islamorada brewing and some other local places they just cant take them down the main road thats kind of the thing theyre not they dont want to do that which i get they dont go fast enough but thats pretty awesome you call the front desk and you ask them for a ride and then right here in the parking lot is the florida keys history and discovery center pretty awesome pretty awesome they have kind of its a big area so like if you look at this building back here and you look how far away the ocean is one two three four buildings away but its pretty awesome what ive noticed kind of everywhere is the the lines for parking our fish its kind of awesome i love stuff like that when were in the tropics i love it i dont want to go home i have to stay our stay here was epic it was actually a really nice resort a little expensive one of the nights because i think they were trying to book for a thousand bucks a night like on new years eve and the day before but yeah you got to pay for what you get and its the garden is amazing here like i said its super clean they really take care of this place and then you get the beautiful sunrise oh my gosh oh my gosh beautiful sunrise so ill show you some of the inside of the room then and there we go ill give you a small tour of pretty much what almost every single room looks like you can get a suite though when we walk in it was really clean high ceilings white and bright its pretty awesome i mean obviously the beds are not made because we are just leaving right now pretty good robe nice just to put your stuff in i love the shutter blinds and again you can walk out you know shuttered lines you can walk out right to your patio and then your front entrance way and then were right on the pool super epic thats pretty much the room at the islander do i recommend this place confidently yes all right were out of here were in fort lauderdale Music you;The Islander Resort in Isla Verrada in the Florida Keys

way they used to these old pros are about to tell all five industry secrets no holds barred tonight repairman unplugged bill Tom Berenger for market plates meet you me Jeff Jeff thanks for coming into our our fake kitchen Phil and Jeff are going public where other repair men we talked to wooden risking an industry backlash you guys have come on to tell us your stories why lets face it things arent mean made the way they were were all a part of it and while stuck with it so what do you do go on TV and try and wake somebody up and theyve each spent more than 35 years in the business seeing a landsliding quality and a flood of customer anger when you go into a house and you have somebody with a relatively new machine and it has a major problem whats the reaction you get you dont want to hear Reese we got to keep it clean so they get upset okay youre damn straight yeah theyre not just her for sure these aint your mothers appliances todays fridges stoves and dishwashers are fancy hightech and often pricey we spend four billion dollars on them every year my crisper yet they seem to be breaking down starts getting filled up with water as fast as they can make them and that keeps Steve Brennen on the road every day I hope to medium dark roast please I have had up to 70 calls in one day Steves our marketplace repairman and says hes busier than ever we should be making these things to last a lot longer today were asking him to help solve a mystery yeah Im not a happy whirlpool customer mark Weitz appliance battles have worn him down he wants to know why his fridge stove and dishwasher all needed fixing I expected them to work like new for at least five years instead its been barely two years I take care of my plants as they werent abused this isnt my fault lets see what the problem is shall we very good whos to blame for what happened thats why Steves here hey Mark morning Tony region for marketplace how are you pleased to meet you Im sustained Brandon hi Dave need some help ah deal yes all right thank you thats great its cold coming by first up marks fridge this is it complete with icemaker and freezer in the bottom uh fridge gave me a quite a scare um I come down in the morning and thered be water pool down here in front of the fridge and I thought hmm mark was stumped so he called whirlpool who hooked him up with a repairman service guy knew exactly what was wrong with it and Im like thats odd how do you know exactly whats wrong with it comes in a clogged drain was causing ice to build up and water to seep out onto the floor he said these series of fridges have this design problem where that drain tube gets clogged up from dirt dust whatever Mike what next question was him was well if whirlpool knows that this is a design problem you know are they gonna cover the repair and he said you know theyve said nothing to us about that our appliance guy has done that repair before if there was a design flaw and the repairman is telling mark that why should he have to pay to get a fixed well really he shouldnt right so if it is a design flaw then he shouldnt have to pay to have it fixed yeah I dont think I should be on the hook for the bill this is a drain issue on a refrigerator which is the most common problem I fix on any refrigerator in fact whirlpool has a replacement kit in case the drain keeps clogging as youll see that sort of thing is common in other brands hello marketplace its Terry in Vancouver Im hoping you can help me with my samsung fridge thats just two years old Terry Lakes fridge is leaking water too Im gonna phone Tom Harrington from CBC and see what he can do for me hi there hi Tom how are ya Im good Terry how are you great thank you very much I have some friends with me okay great we organized a partyline service call for Vancouver so Terry I understand you have a problem with your fridge yes I have a big problem with my fridge its been plaguing me all year would you like to see it Terrys hoping Steve can help ya show us the problem okay this is my fridge and my crisper is filling up with water water in the crisper yeah the water leaking into the vegetable drawer isnt the only problem so Im gonna just pull out the crisper now and so I hope you can see this but now in the last few days Ive got ice forming here okay so we have another refrigerator with a plug drain Terrys been solving a problem the oldfashioned way unplugging it like frostfree freezers went out how many years ago now and now I have a non frostfree fridge for goodness sakes I mean this is craziness its retro thanks yeah with it along with the stainless steel front like Marx whirlpool her Samsung trouble began after the 1year warranty ended got any ideas for me the more we look the more cold hard truths we learn about leaky fridges online there are lots of similar complaints Ill just read you what this one person says the ice is back and my food continues to spoil I dont know if theyre still selling this fridge or not and theres a potential class action lawsuit against Samsung in the US this is 1400 and its garbage crazy I cant live like this so what are shoppers hearing about the reputation of Samsung fridges lets find out the marketplace way shall we were taking our hidden cameras into four major retailers Sears Leons Home Depot and Future Shop our unplug repairmen are watching with us to see if our hidden shopper will hear all the nittygritty from my experience people buy with your eyes you know that looks good and why do the salesmen theyre pretty good too LLL convince you that some of the stuff that no these gadgets that are coming up with her necessities and stuff and in the end you buy into it and you said Samsungs a good a good model I better Samsung myself so far glowing reviews but weve just spotted Terrys fridge this is the oldest fridge in our lineup but it sells so well every year that were we dont want to pull it straight from a Samsung corporate sales guy who happens to be in Home Depot today and how dependable is uh you askin the wrong guy quick shifter as far as you know theres not many issues fragile or 197 the one that seven and Samsung in general very reliable reliable maybe Samsung isnt aware of all the complaints but our insider Phil says the company probably is is it possible that Samsung knows this problem is crossed you already do because when you do warranty work for any company they they want you to put in a code on the work order and that codes supposed to go to the engineering department if they get a thousand of those codes and theyll face whats going on so they track the problems yes meantime our insider Jeff says this is bigger than one brand or one fridge our company is standing by their products like they used to no chance nobody cares and its its really come to that and thats our first repairman secret design flaws are well known in the industry but youre not told about them what did Samsung say when you call them they just said that I wasnt under warranty and I would have to pay to get someone out Samsung should acknowledge that this is a problem if you call us with this problem well fix it for you so thats what they should be doing instead Samsung gives Terry the cold shoulder but mark says dont give up I think you should stick to your guns and dont pay theres no way I want to pay for this dont be like me I felt I didnt even have a choice because water kept pouring out of my floor so I paid Terrys fighting back I mean why should I pay its its absolute insanity to own a new fridge while Terry takes on big appliance so the repairman is coming in hes asking me to shut down the fridge our repairmen are going to reveal more secrets is it reliable nothings reliable sign up with your appliances then divide it on Facebook and Twitter were calling in the repairman telling you what home appliance makers would rather you didnt know right here is the troublemaker secrets people such as Terry Lake wish she knew hmm she owns a fridge on the fritz its leaking water it drips down here and I get a whole lot of water in the crisper so I cant use this crisper horn down the drain thats not all underneath the crisper all across the water Ill get in there and itll freeze into ice pretty stupid for a fridge meantime across the country in Milton Ontario mark Whites fridge needed fixing but that was just the beginning well the dishwasher wasnt washing dishes well my wife was complaining that you know shed find bits and pieces of things in her glasses whatever so the same repairman who fixed his fridge made another house call and replaced a computer board and sensor and that seemed to resolve the problem and relieved me of several hundred dollars you know heres my range but just when mark thought his troubles were over several months later the display panel on him his stove had an issue without the display panel I cannot operate the stove once again it was the electronics our marketplace repairman Steve Brandon isnt surprised electronics and appliances how common is this you have a computer would you take it and put it on top of a hot stove no because you know when the water hits this thing theres a seam so if you have electronics here they are very vulnerable to that the design of modern stoves means more service calls maybe we could make a stove that doesnt blow up when your pasta boils over right our insiders Phil and Jeff have spent decades repairing machines even working for the manufacturers finicky electronics is the single biggest problem they deal with the shift has been through going from mechanical appliances to more electronic and it seemed to select Roenick stuff just doesnt have the longevity the other stuff did thats our second repairman secret electronics often fail and cost lots to fix will we hear that on our shopping tour of big appliance departments controls are electronic so those are something that you have to be careful surprisingly we do get hints when did the problems happen theyre random its electronics right theyre all electronics right theres also conversion area but this salesperson goes one step further telling a repair story of her own with a surprise ending and you said yours broke right mine broke yes Ive got about five years just to buy this piece meaning the computer of the controller it will be about 450 if those dollar would be more money so obviously would be almost the price of binary thats why in the binary ah so thats whats really going on our insiders say that dilemmas no accident it is the industrys grand plan at work I believe my opinion that they dont want you facing it they want you do buy another one I am yeah that actually makes sense to me what else will they price apart so expensive and get this even if you want to repair your appliance Jeff says you might not be able to I can get parts tomorrow for a machine thats 40 years old why cant I get a part tomorrow for a machine thats 2 years old either they cant keep up with the demand on that defective part or theyre just not really willing to invest the money to replace those parts out into the marketplace extremely expensive like thats why the manufacturer shows you a lot because they dont really want you to fix it they want to make it difficult to you to buy the parts and pay for installation because you want you to buy a new right and thats our third repairman secret the high cost of parts and repairs may force you to buy a new machine even if youre lucky and dont have any major troubles how long can you expect any big appliance to last to find out were back in the stores ten years of the most we used to say 15 but Ill tell her last for a hundred years well I think in all honesty I mean you will get at least 12 years out of here your fridge thats what I like to say is sort of the ballpark nowadays how long do they last these things now the fridges or any appliance theres estimated about 1012 years and problemfree the whole time its okay if youre like yup even sales people cant sugarcoat it todays appliances have a much shorter lifespan and that say our insiders is by design to at the end of the day if its built in obsolescence when they say 12 years theyre not saying 12 years problemfree theyre saying at 12 years youre probably going to throw this thing out and in between that 12 years well it at 3 years youre going to have a problem with potentially a board at 5 years you probably have to put another 300 bucks for another board at 7 years youre gonna have a problem with it and they dont tell you that a lot is it gonna last is it reliable nothings reliable and thats our next secret if you hope to keep your appliance for the long haul keep the repairman on speed dial back in Milton mark white couldnt afford to buy new machines whirlpool how much does jinda paying for all the repairs in here over thirteen hundred dollars and none of it under warranty right none of it we asked whirlpool to talk to us on camera about problems with their products this stuff shouldnt be breaking like as if its 20 years old when its like a year and a bit they turn us down but send us this Whirlpool Corporation has been making appliances for more than 100 years and product quality is among our top priorities I believe the manufacturer should be paying for the repairs pterri lakes about to put that to the test in Vancouver this is just absolutely unacceptable shes calling Samsung with an ultimatum I need you to either fix this bridge or give me a bridge that doesnt do this and our insiders share one final secret they can do whatever they want because they dont have to care shopping for new appliances dont get burned find out how at cbcca slash marketplace were taking you inside the world of major home appliances and revealing some major secrets the industry likely wants on the back burner in vancouver terry lakes samsung fridge went on the fritz months after the oneyear warranty expired and it drips down here its been leaking water and icing up now Ive got a frost filled fridge the likely cause a design problem and there are tons of similar complaints about Samsung online dont seem to be any help they dont even acknowledge that theres a problem with this fridge thats what Samsung told her the first time she called but Terrys not giving up she thinks Samsung should cover the cost of the repair I need you to either fix this bridge or give me a fridge that doesnt do this this time she gets through to the higherups okay you bet Thanks thank you when youve been waiting for almost a year a minute or two on hold whats another two minutes at last some good news repair for your case we dont need the hospital sale okay how about that Samsung comes through with a free repair but Terri wonders what took them so long um are you aware of the problem with this fridge okay what is not yet are recalled so we wouldnt call it a recall okay cuz my thought is it should be a recall because seems like when I go on the internet everybody in their dog is having this problem hmm Samsungs not denying there is a problem so the repair mans coming and hes asked me to shut down the fridge before he gets here so that it starts to thaw we asked Samsung to come on camera they freeze us out and send a note instead the company says its committed to delivering high quality products and is promising to offer over the phone assistance to customers with problems Samsung its a real shame that you didnt come on marketplace to explain your position on this and what youre willing to do for your customers the repairman installs some new parts and says that should fix the design problem in the end they have done the right thing for me you have to just keep pressuring them thats for sure dont companies want to compete though to have you as a longlasting customer and build a products that do last and build oil competition I dont see competition anymore really in the end thats because despite all the brands out there our insiders say only a handful of companies is making them same people same people so you dont have a choice we dont have a choice not really and I think thats where the lack of caring starts when all of a sudden you dont have so many choices anymore I think when they wont do whatever they want because they dont have to care because where are you gonna go theres not many players in the game anymore and that is our final repairman secret a lack of competition means the industry has no incentive to be better back in Milton ok I just got a package this morning Oh a light bulb from whirlpool whirlpool is doing some repairs to their reputation after we get involved the company is in a hurry to please mark white they offered to buy back his stove even throw in a bulb for the hood oh yeah he says no to the new stove but guess what whirlpool offers to cover his 1300 repair bill I want to say thank you very much for making me write with this our insiders Phil and Jeff hope theyve done the right thing by coming forward if we can help somebody make the right decision on what theyre buying be a little bit more conscious about

hi Im emerald Robinson and in this what is video were going to tackle the question what is a lake a lake is a body of water that fills a depression in the Earths crust called a basin lakes are usually fairly large in size surrounded by land and are fed and drained by a river or stream compared to other bodies of water like oceans and rivers lakes are fairly calm and have neither large ways nor strong currents there are millions of recognized legs since the definition of what a lake is varies widely and from place to place sometimes small lakes are called ponds and larger ones are called seas at about a hundred and forty three thousand square miles an area the Caspian Sea is considered to be the worlds largest lake while the deepest lake is Russias Lake Baikal which is about a mile in depth lakes are formed in many different ways retreating and melting glaciers can leave lakes in their path other lakes are created by plate tectonics or even by water filling a volcanos crater humans also frequently create lakes for recreation or for hydropower by damming rivers limnology scientists that study freshwater systems can actually determine the lakes age this is because all lakes will eventually dry out as their basins filled with sediment and other natural debris dry lake beds are a common sight in which to find fossils although most lakes contain freshwater there are some exceptions the Great Salt Lake in the United States is what is called a closed lake which means that water only leads the lake by evaporation the Great Salt bakes water is even saltier than ocean water the ways we can classify Lakes are almost too many to count size the amount of nutrients how their water mixes even what types of fish inhabit them are all methods used to classify the Earths mini lakes for thousands of howto and advice videos on any topic visit monkeysee calm you;Sea Lake Baikal Dry lake Great Salt Lake;2
Most people dont know how bicycles actually work Off screen Lets try it again So we modified this bike to prove it This video was sponsored by KiwiCo More about them at the end of the show When youre riding a bike and you want to turn left I think most people just imagine you turn the handlebars to the left This is a bike to test whether that is true And its made by my friend Rick here and hes got a radio controller that allows him to lock out the steering to one side So what hes gonna do is as Im biking hes gonna pick whether I can turn either to the left or to the right So go for it Rick Im giving it a left turn It pulls the pin out but you can see that you can still fully steer after Ive pulled the pin out Ive armed it Theres where it locks OK Now that thats when your LED comes on and that just says turn that way Turn left Yeah And if I try to turn right I cant And if I try to turn left You can I can So the question is can I successfully execute this lefthand turn Should we give it a shot I mean hes not gonna tell me whether its left or right so I have to look at the LED to know which way I can still turn Rick You let me know when youre ready Okay exclaims No That was meant to be a turn to the right but there was no chance in hell Left exclaims Right All right exclaims Right right right God If you look closely you can see the problem Here Im trying to turn right but steering that way puts me off balance If you could ride this bicycle you would find its impossible to turn left without first steering right and its impossible to turn right without first steering left This seems wrong I think most people believe you turn a bike simply by pointing the handlebars in the direction you want to go After all this is how you drive a car Point the front wheels any direction you like and the car just goes that way But the difference with a bicycle is steering doesnt just affect the direction youre headed it also affects your balance Imagine you want to make a right turn so you steer the handlebars to the right What youve done is effectively steered the bike out from under you So now youre leaning to the left and the ground puts a force on the bike to the left so the only way not to fall is to steer the bike to the left You have made a left turn If you really wanted to turn right you first have to countersteer to the left so you can lean right into the turn This is something anyone who rides a bike knows intuitively but not explicitly Turn left Film someone riding a bike towards you and tell them which direction to turn and you will find that they countersteer without even thinking about it Hard left When youre riding a bike its exactly the same as what we call an inverted pendulum or balancing a broomstick on your hand If Im balancing it and I just start walking toward you it will always fall away from you If I want to walk towards you its easy enough to do and people inherently know how to do it If I pull it backward I can now start walking that way I have to initiate the lean to turn into it If you want to move the pendulum somewhere you first move the base in the opposite direction And now the pendulum is leaning in the direction you want to go so you can move with it And its the same with a unicycle In order to go forward first you have to peddle back So youre leaning forward and then you can go forward with it Everything youre doing on a unicycle is all about keeping that contact patch right where it needs to be relative to you Youre balancing the broomstick Its just that on a unicycle you do the longitudinal balance with the pedals and you do the lateral balance the side to side the same as you do with a bike You essentially sorta small countersteer to get that weight to get the contact patch out and then you can pedal and bring it under you Now I should point out that sometimes when the steering locked we just happened to be leaning in the right direction to execute the turn Right right right right right Right right right right Off Screen Oh managed it Essentially by sheer luck we had countersteered before that side of the handlebars locked out Now I can keep going Rick Yeah but dont turn left or youre gonna be screwed I cant turn left Whats interesting about this is it shows that you can still ride the bike perfectly well right Its just you cant turn left The funny thing is that you couldnt initiate the turn I mean the wild takeaway is that steering is not just for turning the bike steering is for balancing Thats exactly right Why is it hard to balance on a stationary bike I think most people believe its because the wheels arent spinning so theres no gyroscopic effect but thats not it The truth is you use steering to keep the bike underneath you but steering doesnt work when youre stationary Your balance comes not so much from how you position your body over the bike but by how you steer the bike to keep it underneath you Even when going straight youre constantly making small steering adjustments to maintain balance Youre moving the contact patch of the front wheel under you Youre doing exactly what you do when you balance a broomstick on your hand So if the rider is responsible for steering the bike to keep it balanced how do bikes without riders stay upright As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed it can keep coasting indefinitely I first became aware of this phenomenon through the great videos by MinutePhysics which inspired me to make this video You should definitely check them out But it turned out the ground where we went to test this effect was really bumpy but the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations and remain stable So how does it do this I think most people believe its the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect that resists falling over just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession Yhe wheel stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down But this is not why bikes are stable Just watch what happens when we lock the handlebars completely so you can only go straight ahead Locked out locked out Whoa All that is happening is the steering is locked You just got to ride it You dont have to turn You just ride Letting go Some people tried going really fast group laughs Others experimented with extreme balancing techniques Hes leaning Dont go too fast group laughs But even with the gyroscopic effect of the wheels no one was able to keep the bike upright for more than a few seconds crowd exclaims This is not safe for a second It is just as hard to balance on a bike with locked steering as it is to balance on a stationary bike No this one is impossible Because you cant steer the bike back under you The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because theyre cleverly designed to steer themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them At least three mechanisms are responsible for a bikes corrective steering The first is that due to the angle of the front fork the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground So if the bike starts leaning to the left the force from the ground on the tire turns the wheel to the left If the bike starts leaning right the force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel like those you find on strollers or shopping carts Whichever way you drive them the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction The second reason for a bikes corrective steering is that the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel are located slightly in front of the steering axis So when the bike leans left their weight pushes the front wheel to the left If the bike leans right their weight steers to the right And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect but it doesnt keep the bike upright directly it just helps steer If you have a gyroscope and you push down on the lefthand side the gyro will turn left If you push down on the right side it will turn right This is known as gyroscopic precession It seems as though the force you apply takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it So bikes are stable primarily because of steering They have builtin mechanisms for steering themselves In fact you dont need all three mechanisms to create a stable bike Researchers created this weirdlooking bicycle to prove a point It has no gyroscopic effect thanks to counterrotating wheels above the wheels that touch the floor Plus there is no caster effect because the front wheel touches the floor in front of the steering axis But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution the force of gravity on which steers it in the direction of any lean Understanding how bicycles work is still an active area of research There is a program you can use to input all the different bicycle parameters and see the range of speeds over which it is selfstable And this research is leading to better bikes This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars to actively help steer keeping the bike upright even at low speeds I guess its fitting that we are still learning new things about bicycles since most of us are able to ride one without any knowledge of how were actually doing it futuristic sound effects play Hey this video
