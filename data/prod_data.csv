"Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/, EYEN-styne; German:  ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year). These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. A joint paper in 1935, with physicist Nathan Rosen, introduced the notion of a wormhole. Alongside physicist Leo Szilard, he invented a refrigerator that consisted of no moving parts and used only heat as an input. In the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose-Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that God does not play dice. Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics. In 1999, he was named Time's Person of the Century.","Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity .

"And my congressional source tonight is Democratic Senator of Connecticut Chris Murphy. And it's great to have you here, Senator, this pause that the judge has put in place on on what the Trump administration has done here is also only temporary. It goes until Monday. The white House was arguing to me today that this is, quote, within the president's power to do it, and therefore he is doing it. Do you believe that the action the Trump administration is taking here is illegal is grossly unconstitutional? it is absolutely clear, based upon prior Supreme Court decisions, but the president cannot unilaterally suspend government programs in order to impose his own priorities and his own policy on top of what was passed by Congress. To me, this is inherently corrupt. What Trump is trying to do is seize control of government spending so that he can send money to his friends and to his loyalists, and he can punish states, for instance, like Connecticut, that are represented by his political opponents. Obviously, today was a day of chaos. The Medicaid program was down, had start reimbursements were down. By the end of the day, they came back up. but what he is trying to do is send a message that if you don't line up with me and my political priorities, it's going to cost you and your state money. How is it affecting people in Connecticut? Because that was kind of how we were hearing that the portals for Medicaid were down, and that they expected them to come back up. But what what did you hear from constituents today about this? Well, what we heard today was that hospitals and doctors weren't getting paid. our headstart programs are preschool programs in Connecticut today started to make plans to lay off employees and consider shuttering their doors to kids because they run in a way where they can't go more than a few days or a week without payment. Our school systems that rely on federal dollars to pay for special education are, as we speak, making plans to potentially downsize, the services that they offer kids in need because they're not sure that those payments will be available to them for the rest of the school year. So the entire state is in crisis right now because so many of our young people are vulnerable. Populations rely on this consistent federal funding. And all we know is that from here until Monday, they will continue to receive that money and then all bets are off. So when the white House argues, as they did today, that individuals who get assistance won't be directly affected. You say I mean, that's not what happened today. I mean, today, Medicaid, which is a payment program that is due to individuals who qualified, was suspended. and there's absolutely no guarantee that individuals who are receiving veterans benefits or housing benefits are going to continue to receive those after Monday. Yeah. And of course, they say Medicaid is not affected. They were they are aware at the white House that the portals were down, which obviously speaks to to the confusion that was caused by this coming out last night. Some of your Republican colleagues were asked about this, what you just got out there, which is that this is Congress's power of the purse here in allocating this funding. This is what some Republicans had to say about this. I think it's appropriate to take a look at it and make sure there isn't. some of the various various think that some of the areas that could be restricted if they are, items of the executive branch has the authority to issue or to look at. He's not holding, he's reviewing it. And in the meantime, he's going to release it again. that's what he ran on. Why do you think the Republicans on Capitol Hill were not bothered or near as bothered as you are by by a very clear willingness by the white House to to subvert Congress when it comes to funding. I think for two reasons. One, they're pretty confident that if Trump is in charge of what states get money or what disasters get money, that their constituents in their states will be taken care of. Two this is also an exercise in withholding all of these payments so that the president can reserve money to pay for his giant tax cut, mostly going to billionaires and corporations. Think that's what he's doing here? I think that's part of the rationale here, is trying to create a pretext in which he can say, hey, don't worry about how much I'm giving away in a corporate tax cut or an elimination of the estate tax on the wealthiest billionaire families, because I saved a bunch of money by shutting down, funding for elementary schools and middle schools in this country. So for Republicans, their money probably still, you know, comes to their states and they get to, a little bit better argument that they have the money to pay for the billionaire and corporate tax cuts. I think all states right now are affected by this and the confusion of what this actually gets to. But the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said that he doesn't think it's unusual for an administration to pause funding and take a hard look and scrub how these programs are being spent and how they interact with the executive orders Trump signed. Is that how you see it, or do you believe this is a highly unusual. Well, it's not what I believe. It's just true. Never before in the history of the country has a president suspended all at once, virtually every federal program and every foreign aid program, and also sent out an order to agencies that if you see or suspect anyone inside your agency that isn't complying, you are to report them inside USAID. Yesterday, as you know, almost the entire senior leadership was dismissed, in an attempt to rid the agency of anybody that didn't share the very particular political priorities of the president. All of this is completely unprecedented. Stephen Miller is the deputy chief of staff to the deputy advisor to Trump, the Homeland Security advisor, when it comes to to policy on the former of there he was on with Jake Tapper earlier and he actually talked about these USAID employees. This is what he had to say. There's 2 million employees in the federal government. Overwhelmingly, the career federal service in this country is far left, left wing. The American people, I don't know that to be a fact. Well, I'll give you a great example. We looked at USAID as an example. That's 98%, 98% of the workforce, either, donated to Kamala Harris or their left wing candidate. What is your reaction to a senior West Wing employee seeming to say that they are looking into the political affiliations of career government employees? First of all, that's not true. 98% of employees at USAID did not donate to Kamala Harris. They are making, you said, or a left wing candidate was. They are they're they're making up facts. yes. They have made no bones about it. They want to purge from government people who just show up every day to implement the law and the Constitution. The only qualification to Donald Trump for you to serve in government is if you pledge a loyalty oath to him personally and are willing to facilitate his corruption. He is trying to turn government into an enrichment vehicle for his billionaire friends. He wants to steal from ordinary people in order to help his Mar a Lago crowd. And if you aren't interested in that agenda, then you can't work for the president of the United States. All those people, USAID, they are not partizans. They are not political. They are just trying to implement a system of assistance around the world that protects U.S. interests. Some people may ask, okay, everything you just laid out there, what are Democrats doing about it? House Democrats are having an emergency meeting tomorrow on Trump's federal funding freeze. But, I mean, it happened last night. We had today with all the confusion. Do you think that your party is responding to to Trump in a way that is that works in your view? Well, I think today has been a wake up call. what we did in the Senate today was denied the Republicans the ability to proceed to any legislation that doesn't have to do with restoring this funding and ending this corruption. I hope that my colleagues will view nominees to a different lens right now. We have Lee Zeldin up for the EPA tomorrow. Whatever you think about Lee Zeldin, he's going to the EPA to implement a deeply corrupt and unconstitutional policy. So I hope the Democrats will take a harder line on legislation and on nominees, because our entreaties to the country are arguments that this is a five alarm fire, are not going to be taken as serious unless we are using all the powers that we have available to us to stop the implementation of this corrupt agenda inside the new administration. And of course, Zeldin would argue that point that you made about what he's going to do at the EPA. there is a question of of these nominees. Some Democrats are trying to stall the vote for Russ. Vote who is Trump's pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, which handles all of this when it comes to the trillions of dollars in federal funding. He worked primarily on project 2025. He was questioned about it a lot in his briefing. This pause today, and this idea that they can eliminate parts of federal funding that Trump does not believe fits with his agenda, does align with what you read of some in project 2025. What do you make of that? You know, Trump said during the campaign, I don't know anything about project 2025. Those people aren't going to have anything to do with my administration. The people who are writing these executive orders are the people that constructed project 2025. And what project 2025 is, is an evisceration of democracy, so that the only people that serve in government are people that believe in deeply conservative ideas and believe in, preserving Donald Trump's political power. So yes, you are seeing project 2025 being put into effect right now. And Russ vote was, you know, one of the the prime authors and pushers of that agenda. Yeah. He seems very likely to get confirmed. Senator Chris Murphy, thank you for your time tonight.","julian zelizer: it's a wake-up call for the white house to pause funding . he says the president is trying to seize control of government spending so that he can send money to his friends and to his loyalists .

I'm Frank Proto a professional chef and coloring instructor and today I'm going to show you how to make a perfectly juicy chicken breast Frank style we're talking succulent delicious chicken breast not that dry stringy stuff that your grandma serves this is chicken breast 101 chicken breast doesn't need to be dry and stringy with a little bit of knowledge a little bit of technique it can be Juicy and Delicious every single time in front of me I have two different chicken breasts one is a little smaller one is a little larger I try and go for the smaller ones I feel like they're more tender they have a better texture this chicken breast I'm going to leave alone this chicken breast needs a little work before we can put it in the pan I'm going to take this chicken breast and I'm just going to get my chef knife put a flat hand on top and kind of cut it right down the center you'll notice that when I put my hand on top my thumb is kind of pointed up my fingers are pointed up I'm just putting light pressure down that light pressure will make it easier to cut and now we basically have two chicken breast from the one I feel like this is a better size to cook if it's too thick it takes a little longer you get dry ends and the center is usually a little pink so this way it's going to cook much more evenly some people will tell you pound this out with a meat mallet I don't really like to do that because I want my chicken breast to be nice and brown and if I pound it out and then sauté it it's going to be way overcooked by the time it's ready to eat when it comes to seasoning chicken breasts I'm a minimalist salt and pepper only spice rubs tend to burn when you sauté them when you're sautéing a chicken breast you want to make sure that before you put it in the pan you get a paper towel and Pat it dry that extra moisture will stop our chicken from browning so get all that excess moisture off before you put it in the pan when I season I use kosher salt and fresh crack black pepper whenever you season you want to start really high if I was to season like this you get little spots of salt if you season High you get a nice even distribution of salt pepper go a little bit on a fine grind with this and then we can turn it over and season the other side you want to season both sides chicken seasoned ready to go let's cook I have a stainless steel sauté pan in front of me I like these because they're a bit of a thicker gauge they're heavy bottom stainless steel sauté pan if you have a thin sauté pan what happens is you get burnt spots and undercooked spots I like to use cast iron for a lot of things like this but when I'm doing a pan sace I don't like cast iron because believe it or not it gets a little of that flavor from the pan that's why I use stainless steel there is no flavor transfer from the pan to the sauce when sautéing you want high temperature for a shorter amount of time you see I put salt on this chicken breast salt draws out moisture so before we go in the pan again you want to dab this to make sure they're not wet this way we ensure proper Browning my Pan's getting hot I like to use a neutral high smoke point Oil we're just using a vegetable oil here I don't use fancy oils for this because once they go in the pan all the flavor disappears and you can see right away it looks like waves it looks kind of shimmery and that's what I want if there's a little bit of smoke that's a good thing I'm going to dab off my chicken breasts and then when I drop them in the pan I'm dropping away from myself if I drop it towards myself I'm getting splashed with oil if I drop it away from myself I am not getting splashed with oil to lower my heat down a little don't be afraid to adjust your heat if you have to right now now I feel like I have the right amount of heat I took a quick peek underneath to see that I was Browning my chicken wasn't sticking but for the most part at this point you want to just leave it alone let the sauté pan do its work don't mess around don't move it around too much you can check occasionally to see how you're doing right we're getting some nice Browning in there don't mess around with it too much leave it alone I have a little bit of a dry spot here cuz the pan is a little boded in the middle so the oil kind of went to the edges so you'll notice that I always want my chicken breast to be sitting in the oil what this does is I don't have high spots and low spots my chicken Cooks nice and even on the surface what I'm looking for here is that we have a nice golden brown on that side look at that that's beautiful and then what I'm doing is I'm poking my chicken breast I know that it's raw but as I poke onto it it's super soft and as it Cooks to the right temperature it's going to go from super soft and kind of spongy to being really bouncy and that's what I'm looking for the texture of it right I don't want it to be soft and spongy I want it to kind of bounce back really nice you'll notice that I only have two breasts in here I have a third but I think that if I put too many in the pan it's going to overcrowd the pan what happens basically is it starts to steam steam is moisture and then your chicken breast does not get brown so don't overcrowd your pan I feel like this chicken breast is ready to go if you touch it it's got some nice bounciness to it I'm going to take it out and put it onto my resting rack this piece is a little thicker it needs a little more time you notice that I use my fingers cuz I have Chef hands you can always just push down with tongs to see how your bounciness is most people say that chicken breast needs to be cooked to about 165 in order for it to be fully cooked I find if chicken breast gets cooked to 165 it's dry I tend to go about 150 155 because they will continue to cook when you put them over here it's called carryover cooking if you're really unsure about when to take it off off you can always use a thermometer I kind of go by touch and feel even if it's a little pink or a little underdone we can always reheat it before we put the sauce on right now I'm getting some nice good spring back I'm going to take this out and let it rest I put my chicken on the resting rack so the meat can kind of equalize the juices can redistribute and we'll have a nice juicy chicken breast so you can see my chicken breast is nice and brown it's got some nice caramelization and that equals flavor I have some of my juices running off I can always reclaim those if I want part of the reason why chicken breast is so easy to mess up is because it's a super lean cut of meat there's little to no fat on it unless you keep the skin it's going to be a dry piece of meat so cooking it properly is where it's at for our chicken breast today we're going to do a super simple pan sauce that anyone can make you don't need to be a culinary genius to get this right if you're sautéing chicken breast a pan sauce is your friend in restaurants pan sauces don't really get made because they take a lot of time but this is a great technique for the home cook the star of the show here is that font and that is really necessary for a good pan sauce a fond is all the caramelized juices in the bottom of the pan it's super flavorful it's going to give color to your sauce uh and it's just going to make it taste great so my pan is getting hot I'm going to put just a little bit of fresh oil not a lot so I have about a couple of shallots here DIC nice and fine so you'll notice that I cook my shallots a little before I add my garlic I have a couple of cloves ofar garlic there Pan's a little dry so I'm just going to add a little more oil cuz I want these to sizzle and get nice and caramelized and brown so now my garlic and shallots are nice and brown I'm going to add chicken stock it stops the cooking of my shallots and garlic and that's going to be the main flavor base we're going to reduce this down reduction is a really great way to get flavor chicken stock by itself isn't super flavorful but if you reduce it you get a really nice chicken flavor it's probably going to take about 7 to8 minutes to reduce you got to got to be patient here take your time I turn my heat up a little cuz I want this to come to a simmer really quickly any chicken juices that you have should be put in there not oil but the juice that juice comes out of the chicken while it rests that should be put in your sauce do not waste that so we're going to let this come to a simmer you'll see that it's starting to come to a boil if you look at my bubbles here my bubbles are really small and fine as you reduce things like chicken stock you'll notice that it starts to get a little thicker and the bubbles get a little a little bit bigger and that'll tell you your sauce is getting to the right consistency just watch the Bubbles at this point I'm going to add just a pinch of salt I'm not going to go crazy with the salt because we're reducing this if you season this all the way right now and then you reduce it it's going to be way too salty little salt a little pepper and then we'll readjust later on when the sauce is close to being done the sauce is reduced by half I add my butter and that's that's what I want I want the butter to incorporate into the sauce at this point I'm making sure that I got everything off the bottom of the pan and I'm just going to mix it up so you can actually see my bubbles on the side getting bigger my sauce is getting thicker the butter emulsifies into the sauce and makes it creamy and delicious the classic French term for this is Monte o bur or to mount with butter I'm going to adjust and lower my heat and let this go a little slower so you can see my sauce is starting to get thick but what I'm looking for is that nape consistency and if I put my spoon in there and I run my finger through you can still see that it's a little liquidy it's not really sticking to my spoon but I want this this to kind of stick to my spoon and get a little thick right so you can see we have considerably less liquid than we did earlier what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn my heat on super low uh I'm going to hit it with some lemon juice one thing that I like to do is take the cut side and put it on my hand and when I squeeze I squeeze towards my hand so that the seeds get trapped in between my hand and the lemon half I like to add the lemon juice at the end because I want it to be fresh and bright I don't want really cooked lemon juice flavors just a little more seasoning salt and pepper I'm going swirl that around so the sauce is ready and this is what I'm looking for there's a lot less liquid in this pan right the sauce looks creamy it's thick I coat the back of my spoon I run my finger through there's a very sharp line and you can see on either side the sauce is stuck to my spoon and what you can do now is add some parsley parsley has a really nice bright fresh flavor to it I like to add it right at the end most people add just for color I love the flavor but look at that see how much sauce we have it's not a lot but it's nice and thick it's got a nice creamy consistency and that's our Pan sace the pan sace is done the chicken is rested it is time to Plate now I like to slice my chicken breast just to give it a little more visual peel so we can see the inside of it one thing that I always focus on here is this end piece no matter what I do this end piece is going to be a little dry so what I like to do is cut that Chef's neack now with our chicken breast I want to slice on a nice long angle you can see inside it's not dry it's still got some bounce to it it's Juicy and Delicious not overcooked I like to put the pan sauce on the bottom of the plate because if you take that pan sauce and put it on top you're kind of hiding that nice Browning that you did not only that it's kind of crispy and you're going to take away that crispiness that's a chicken breast I want to eat time to taste let's get in there you can see that it's nice and soft and tense tender it is not dry and stringy whenever I eat a chicken breast like this the sauce is key mop up the sauce as much as you can by the end of this your plate should be totally clean chicken breast can be delicious it's just takes a little technique a little bit of knowhow and patience it can be juicy I promise you,I have a stainless steel sauté pan in front of me I feel like this is a better size to cook if it's too thick it takes a little longer you get dry ends . when I drop them in the pan I'm dropping away from myself if I drop it towards myself I am getting splashed with oil to lower my heat down . I want this to come to a simmer really quickly any chicken juices that you have should be put in there not oil but the juices can redistribut,3,v1
"this is a narco submarine A stealth marine vehicle designed to transport drugs from South America to the US and sometimes even Europe over the last decade authorities have caught over 200 of these but there are many more out there today we will take a look at four different models ranging from simple all the way to transatlantic high-tech how do these submarines work how do they avoid detection and what does the Coast Guard do to catch  them there are many ways to smuggle cocaine into the high-profit markets of the US and Europe each year authorities seiz several hundred tons of cocaine before it reaches the streets and many more tons get past them in this game of cat and mouse cartel's constant come up with new ways to deliver their product at first Naros Subs were made for short trips but over time their production was professionalized a hidden industry began to flourish this is Oscar Moreno Ricardo Colombian authorities named him the king of semi submersibles here deep in the dense Colombian jungle hidden along a river he operates a clandestine Shipyard far beyond the reach of authorities in places like this one Ricardo and his competitors built submarines they can travel thousands of miles across the ocean carrying tons of cocaine these Narco submarines are designed to remain hidden but there are rare moments when we get a glimpse into their world hi Sutton studies the craft of Ricardo and the others he has dedicated his career to uncovering their secrets he's a specialist in defense analysis and unconventional Naval Warfare I've been looking at Narco submarines for about 15 years and keeping a database of all the incidents of Narco submarines and analyzing their designs and the trends that are evolving in that space now let's dive into our first sub this is a very typical Narco submarine they started to appear like this in the late 2000s and they're still being found today it's roughly 14 m in length and not a true submarine rather it's a so-called lowprofile vessel the top remains visible above the water line its color Blends in with the sea due to its low height radar systems have a hard time detecting it currently it is on route to Central America inside the cramped vessel five men sit in 10 silence every so often the low hum of the diesel engine pulses through the hull as it pushes them forward at 16 kmph the sub is divided into three compartments this middle is the crew area it's sparse and uncomfortable bunks cremm tightly together a single hatch above for entry here at the rear the diesel engine Roars vibrating against the thin fiberglass walls it is located behind the crew compartment so they can access it to do repairs up front the cargo hold is tightly packed with backs of cocaine 7.7 tons to be precise the crew uses the weight of the drugs Fuel and engine to keep the vessel low in the water the cargo on board will earn the cartel a hefty sum if the sub reaches its destination a Marine Patrol aircraft spots the Narco submarine and immediately alerts the US Coast Guard right now they are operating an international Waters two small boats and a helicopter raced to intercept the vessel once within range Coast Guard officers jump onto the ship and give the door a friendly knock they captured the five Smugglers along with the cocaine valued at well over $200 million if law enforcement had not acted so decisively the Smugglers could have opened the scuttling valve a last resort mechanism that floods the this up and sends it plunging to the ocean floor along with all its evidence This Crew had a relatively short Journey others travel half across the  world while Naros Subs are obviously used for organized crime their engineering and the Ingenuity behind their design are undeniably

start developing new skills  today a different part of the Amazon a NCO vessel departs near manau in Brazil and is making its way to makaa the Amazon's mouth this semi up was over 20 M long and nicknamed CH inside CH said three men August te Alvarez a former Spanish boxer and captain of The Vessel and two Ecuadorian men they are about to cross the Atlantic traveling at around 19 kmph they will cover roughly 6 and 1 12,000 km from the Brazilian Rainforest all the way to Europe with no GPS and only a compass to guide their way it will take them about 2 weeks to reach their destination if all goes according to plan this knos up is very similar to our first one but it is more modern and larger it also has three compartments you've got the engine in the back the crew in the middle and the cargo Bank nearly half the sub size is reserved for fuel three massive tanks holding 20,000 L ensuring The Vessel can make the long journey the men have no proper beds and use plastic bags as toilets for food they have the choice between energy bars rice or cans of sardines there's only one proper seat so two men must lie down at all times the men endured three storms and almost hit a larger ship on the way but finally managed to cross the Atlantic but well luck is not on their side after 27 days the sub runs out of fuel the journey took twice as long as planned because of the conditions at Sea they can't deliver the drugs to another vessel two attempts to meet with cartel boats fail as a last resort Alvarez contacts old friend from his hometown vgo and hopes to get help from them to unload the cocaine but this also fails so they travel near the coast of Galicia and sink The Vessel afterwards the crew wants to flee but law enforcement has already spotted them the eu's maritime analysis and operation Center has notified Spain that a suspicious vessel is heading for their Coast they watched them using night vision goggles and observed their arrival in Galicia officials arrested two Ecuadorian men shortly after the sinking Alvarez can flee he hides nearby in an abandoned house for 5 days and then finally gets arrested Spanish police refloat and confiscate the sunken submarine they find three tons of cocaine worth around $100 million every time one of these gets caught a cartel loses a lot of money reason enough to innovate at first glance this just looks like a real submarine it has the typical cylindrical shape and is around 24 M long this build can almost fully submerge only a snorkel protrudes from its top allowing the vessel to breathe drawing in air to cool its diesel engine and provide fresh oxygen for the crew it also gives the vessel its name the snorkel sub unlike most real submarines or or most Naval sub Marines is not built out of steel or metal it's built out of fiberglass a diesel engine Powers this up while an onboard generator provides electricity for various systems including a camera mounted at top the snorkel so they always have an idea of what's around them when they're underwater Bast tanks allow it to take in water and dive deeper when danger is spotted the interior feels crammed yet sophisticated there's a basic toilet and a sink small luxuries that make long Journeys more bearable for the crew the snorkel sub can haul up to 8 tons of cocaine carrying its eled cargo thousands of kilometers from Colombia to destinations like Mexico or Beyond so far not a single one of these has ever been caught at sea but we know they keep building them because the ones that we have got like this have always been captured on land so we can infer from that that they must be very successful and that makes sense Patrol aircraft will have a much harder time spotting this up through its camera system it can maneuver around and evade Coast Guard ships with much greater finesse the fact that such a complex machine gets built in a jungle in the middle of nowhere is remarkable these shipyards are far from traditional Supply chains or modern facilities Narco submarines are designed and the construction is overseen by Master Builders these are Artisans very technically proficient they're impressive designs in the sense that while they might look very shoddy and Mill they really are the perfect example of the minimum viable product these Subs need to be good enough to reliably transport extremely expensive cargo thousands of miles but at the same time they have to be built with very basic materials not many people are capable of doing that these Master Builders there's only so many of them and we can tell that because each designer if you like has signature they they have certain ways of solving problems that reveal themselves in the designs and one of these Builders far outshines the rest in November 2020 law enforcement stumbled upon something extraordinary in the Colombian jungle a fully submersible 12 M long Narco submarine there's no fuel storage and no diesel engine in the back instead the subh hous is a whopping 10 tons of batteries powering two electric motors this is the peak of Nao sub Ingenuity construction costs roughly $1.5 million dive planes control the depth of the submarine its batteries have an estimated endurance of 12 hours traveling at 5 kmph this sub could reach a travel distance of about 60 km this sub can travel neither fast nor far but it doesn't have to this vessel is not designed to make long Journeys on its own do you see this little thing here that's a towering ring it can be attached to larger ships allowing the Narco sub to be pulled long distances undetected when the Smugglers reach their destination or Coast Guard appears they simply unhook and continue on their own this up is extremely hard to detect in fact it has never been found in action authorities have only discovered this one example in the Colombian jungle but there are most likely many more of them out in the waters we can infer that it's incredibly successful just like the other all Narco submarines are statistically successful most get through but these ones are even harder to find and has never never been seen in the wild this Naros is proof that drug smugglers continue to design new sophistic ated vessels to move drugs into profitable markets the trend has been towards smaller payad they carry less drugs than they used to but there's more of them and so it's really about optimizing their supply lines and getting the the drugs to the market minimizing the risks when the sub completes its Mission it may end up here in a massive graveyard of Nako subm Marines on the ocean floor because almost all of them are only Built for a one-off trip in 2022 the reign of Oscar Moreno Ricardo the so-called king of Narco submarines came to an end after years of eluding authorities he was finally arrested in a joint operation by Colombian and American authorities his capture marks a significant victory for law enforcement but it is far from a decisive blow another worthy successor will most likely have already taken his place somewhere in the depths of the Colombian jungle a new genius is already working on the next generation of Narco submarines more advanced more sophisticated and designed to beat the latest tactics of law enforcement",Naros Subs are designed to transport drugs from South America to the US and sometimes even Europe over the last decade . they are a very typical Narco submarine they started to appear like this in the late 2000s and they're still being found today it's roughly 14 m in length and not a true submarine . the sub is divided into three compartments this middle is the crew area it is sparse and uncomfortable bunks cremm tightly together a single hatch above for entry here .,4,v1
"this is the tyang go on board is Kim Jong-un the ruler of North Korea he almost never leaves his country but when he does he travels on rail in the so-called moving Fortress right now he just left pongyang his destination is the v kodom in Russia to meet Vladimir Putin the journey will take him around 2 days and well over 1,000 km through for on land Kim has many enemies how does the tyang go

them out you support our reporting the tyang go is escorted by two additional trains one drives ahead to check for dangers like planted explosives on the tracks or ambushes on the sides the other one secures the back it is filled with heavily armed secur security ready to rush to the Supreme Leader's rescue if need be a helicopter Scouts the area ahead he accompanies the Convoy the entire time Kim is traveling through North Korean territory cargo planes station additional Personnel at the closest airports along the Route the tyang go has reinforced bulletproof windows its walls and bottom are hardened to withstand explosions multiple compartments are carrying heavy Weaponry the train is equipped to fight back against attacks from above with anti-aircraft missiles it also carries anti-tank missiles and two machine guns to aggressively fend off attacks from either side of the tracks if all defenses fail the train carries a helicopter so Kim can flee from the scene all this makes Kim's train extremely safe but also extremely heavy the tyan go travel Trav at only 60 kmph sometimes even slower due to the poor condition of Railways in North Korea when the train passes by a station the power is cut off on all other tracks there are 20 Railway stations in the country that were built solely for this one train because of the slow speeds Kim might be on the road for several days on end just like during this particular trip to meet Putin on board he has everything he needs to govern his Country Day and Night an office with a desk laptop television fax machine satellite phone and a map of China in the Korean Peninsula on the wall a reception room a meeting room with a table the interior style is quite eclectic most rooms are entirely white with shiny wooden floors there are green and hot pink sofas Ivory and turqu oise curtains flower-shaped lamps and zebra patterned fabric seats but the highlight of the train is the restaurant on board you can find all sorts of Delicacies from Korean Russian Chinese Japanese and French cuisine Kim Jong-un won't get bored during the journey either the train has singers on board who serenade the supreme leader personally when stepping off the train two onard Bo armored Mercedes limousines are unloaded for the last mile train travel has a long tradition in the Kim family this is the kumu Xin Palace where the remains of kimil sun and Kim Jong Il are laid to rest right next to their remains you'll find life-size models of their personal train carriages there's even said to be a painting of Kim Jong Il proudly standing next to his train a map with small lights shows the many Journeys they took taking the train started as a safety precaution Kim Jang ill was reportedly also just a bit afraid of flying in 2001 he took a train journey lasting almost a month all the way to Moscow covering a total of 20,000 km a Russian official named Constantine pakowski accompanied him after the journey he published a book about his experiences much to the irritation of both the Russian and North Korean governments that's because for a long time the Korean leaders trains were shrouded in utter mystery it was never announced when they would move and where also the interior was largely kept secret in 2004 Kim Jong 's train passed the Yung Chung station near the border with China just hours later a massive explosion killed about 160 people and injured 1,300 more supposedly a train parked at the station Laden with oils and chemicals was hitting power lines there were speculations that this might have been an assassination attempt that's not entirely unlikely there have been many reports of internal power struggles in North Korea over the decades the security of the train was reportedly boosted after the incident in 2009 Russian photographers were banned from taking pictures of the train while it was on route to the then president Dimitri Medvedev entire villages in Siberia were instructed to stay indoors until the train had passed in the era of smartphones this is no longer possible and in some cases not really desired because the train also serves propaganda  purposes the taang go fittingly means Sun it has become a powerful symbol for North Korea Kim Jong-un is said to use it to appear down toe and close to the people in Star contrast to the lofty image of the US president his giant jumbo jet and political leaders traveling by train is one way or another a symbol after the invasion of Ukraine the airspace above the country became unsafe many Western leaders started to visit Kiev by train through Poland this has been coined as iron diplomacy in the case of North Korea the tyang go in some ways accentuates just how uniquely isolated the country is the Supreme leaders rarely or perhaps never visit most parts of the world there's also a certain irony in the train supposedly symbolizing the modesty of the Kim family Journeys always have a destination Kim's train finally arrives at fi cosmodome he is greeted with one of the longest and perhaps most uncomfortable handshakes in history then Putin gives him the full tour a space port an aircraft Factory and the Pacific Fleet later there's vodka a ballet performance and a walrus show the reason the two men meet is quite serious however Russia is running low on ammunition and allies and its war against Ukraine North Korea has enormous stocks of ammo and is not afraid to supply it in return the country could receive technical support from Russia for building new satellites and missiles for its nuclear weapons program no official outcome has been announced but Russian foreign minister Sergey lavro recently visited pangang shortly after the meeting he thanked North Korea for its support in the Ukraine conflict and reaffirm the partnership between both countries North Korea in turn officially recognize the territories captured by Russia as Russian Sovereign territory lavro didn't commit on weapons deliveries but according to the US government North Korea has already delivered over 1,000 containers of ammunition and military equipment to Russia North Korea and Russia both have very few International allies left while the tyang go tries to be a symbol of power for North Korea it is also a sign of the country's deep isolation Vladimir Putin has accepted an offer to visit Kim Jong-un and return this would be a good chance for him to take his very own ghost  train",the tyang go is escorted by two additional trains one drives ahead to check for dangers like planted explosives on the tracks . the other one secures the back it is filled with heavily armed secur security ready to rush to the Supreme Leader's rescue if need be a helicopter Scouts .

A PID identifies and locates an entity regardless of where it is hosted or published and enables its unambiguous and long-term identification. PIDs are an essential component of the research ecosystem, linking researchers and research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. In this blog post, we will explore the different types of PIDs, their applications, and how researchers can use PIDs to comply with the FAIR data principles and the funder requirements. Types of PIDs There are several types of PIDs commonly used in research, shown as follows. PIDs for People (Researchers): Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers (ORCID iDs) PIDs for Objects (Research Outputs): Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) PIDs for Places (Research Organizations): Research Organization Registry (ROR) IDs, and Crossref Funder Registry IDs ORCID iDs are assigned to researchers and support automatic links to their research outputs. ORCID iDs can be linked to a researcher’s affiliations, funding sources, and publications, making it easier to identify their contributions and track their research impact. DOIs are the most widely used PIDs assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, protocols, books, datasets, and software. DOIs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite digital objects, facilitating their discoverability, accessibility, and interoperability. RRIDs are unique identifiers assigned to research resources such as antibodies, cell lines, model organisms, and other tools (software, databases, services). RRIDs enable researchers to unambiguously identify and cite the research resources they use, facilitating reproducibility and reuse of research data. ROR IDs are unique identifiers assigned to research organizations, including universities, research institutes, and funding agencies. ROR IDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their affiliated organizations, making tracking research impact and identifying collaborations easier. Crossref Funder Registry IDs are unique identifiers assigned to funding agencies, allowing researchers to track the funding sources of their research outputs and demonstrate the impact of specific funding programs. Applications of PIDs to Comply with FAIR Data Principles PIDs are not only critical to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles but also to making data machine-readable or machine-actionable. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder IDs in research outputs, researchers can make data more easily discoverable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, and machine-actionable. Machine-actionable data means that data can be processed and understood by machines or software. PIDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata, making it easier to discover and access research data. PIDs also facilitate the reuse of research data or protocols by enabling researchers to easily cite and credit the sources of their data and protocols. PIDs also play a critical role in ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of research data. PIDs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite their research resources, facilitating the replication of experiments and ensuring the accuracy of research data. By incorporating PIDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their data more interoperable, allowing machines to process data and metadata more efficiently. PIDs follow established standards and enable data to be shared and reused without the need for transformations, making data more interoperable with existing and future systems. This facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources and enables researchers to make new discoveries that would not be possible without PIDs. In conclusion, PIDs play a critical role in research by enabling the unique identification, citation, and linking of research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder Registry IDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their research outputs more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR data principles) required by many funders and publishers and contribute to the open data ecosystem.

Also, new French Revolution Merch available now in the store, including King Louis and Marie Antoinette character pins, complete with detachable heads just like the real thing. (At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly Governor de Launay has defeated them, and has them on the run. No need to worry. - Uh, your Majesty Isn't that Governor de Launay's head on a pike? - Well... Clearly, Governor de Launay has taken on the form of a bodyless, pike-head deity and the people are so enamored with him, they're parading him around the city. No need to worry AT ALL. (quickly drives away) When the National Assembly heard about the violence that had taken place, they had two options: either one, they denounce it, and try to carry on the Revolution using peaceful means, or two, they say: 'Damn, you stuck his head on a pike? That's pretty hardcore, and WE LOVE IT! Incidentally, they went with option #2. Some historians believe this reaction paved the way for the utter violence and bloodshed that would become the legacy of the French Revolution. This widespread acceptance of violence during the Revolution is also largely accredited to the writings of a certain Jean-Paul Marat. A man of science, with a horrible skin condition that kept him confined to a bathtub. He began writing a radical newspaper he affectionately named: 'The Friend of the People' - Citizens of France, be very afraid Given the chance, the King and the nobility won't hesitate to massacre us all. The solution is simple: EXECUTE THEM! Kill every last one of them! Cut off a thousand heads, and if that isn't enough, CUT OFF A THOUSAND MORE! (rubber duck rises) Oh! Hey Mr. Squeaky. What are you doing down there? You're so cute! (squeezes duck) Awwww, I love you too, Mr. Squeaky. (kisses duck) Now where was I? Oh yeah...... Kill them all It became one of the most popular publications in Paris during the revolution, and succeeded in spreading ever increasing fear and anger among the people. In August, leaders of the National Assembly, with help from a certain Thomas Jefferson, adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen- an incredible document that guaranteed liberty and equal rights to all men. And when I say men, I mean men. (not women) Despite its glaring shortcomings in gender equality, the massively influential Declaration would go on to inspire the struggle for liberty and equality across the planet for centuries. However, back in France, the vast majority of the people weren't really so concerned with enlightened ideas of equality as much as they were concerned with the fact that they were still starving. Bread was still expensive as hell and hard to come by. The people felt that one reason that nothing had been done yet about the crisis was because the King simply couldn't see the problem. He lived in Versailles, a full 20 km southwest of Paris. And as a result, lived in comfort, separated from his dirty, stinking subjects. On October 5, a crowd of women, 7,000 strong, decided to do something unprecedented. They decided they'd remove that separation, and confront the king directly. The women marched all the way to the King's palace in Versailles. Along the way, the crowd continued to grow into the tens of thousands. And when they arrived, they demanded an audience with the King. - What are those 'things' outside the palace? - They're poor people, your Majesty - THAT'S POOR PEOPLE?!! - They say they're hungry. - Hungry? Then let them eat cake. - Wow. See, this is the exact BS that led to this whole mess in the first place. You're SO out of touch. They're writhing around in the filth breaking their backs to barely scrape by and they come to you demanding just the basic ability to feed themselves and you think a slice of cake will sort them out? - Well... then let them eat Taco Bell Crunch Wrap Supreme. - Wow! They're not THAT desperate! Members of the crowd actually managed to break into the palace with the intention of killing the Queen who narrowly escaped through a secret passage in her bedroom. The enraged mob killed several members of the Royal guard, and raised their head on pikes, which if you haven't noticed yet, is something they were quite fond of doing. The King had no choice, but to come out and talk to the crowd. He agreed to accept his new position, sharing power with the Revolutionary government and to return to Paris with the crowd, removing the separation between King and Subject. King Louis had a problem with people constantly raiding his palace. But one thing he didn't have a problem with was people raiding his computer- because he used NordVPN.

Also, new French Revolution Merch available now in the store, including King Louis and Marie Antoinette character pins, complete with detachable heads just like the real thing. (At a French party) - So I said to the Marquis de la Foofayette What do you think I am? Some dirty peasant? I've never worked a day in my life! (Laughter) - Wow, that Marie Antoinette sure is pretty. - Sure is! - Wouldn't want to be Prince Louis though. That's gonna be a lot of responsibility when he becomes king. -Especially since France is in financial ruin! - Quite! - Thank you one and all for attending the royal marriage of my grandson, the future King of France to the archduchess of Austria. Now for the very awkward, yet historically accurate part of the ceremony, where we all watch them get into bed together. (Inside Louis XVI's bedroom where the guests proceed to watch him in bed). - Alright, now that's out of the way let's leave the royal couple to it. (In a menacing tone) - You better give us an heir you FAT ILL-BRED BOY! (Creepily) - Nighty-night. (turns lights off and closes door) - That's gonna be a lot of responsibility. - France is in financial ruin. - You FAT, ILL-BRED BOY! - Quite! (Random voices moving around) (Prince Louis freaks out) - Oh great, he's a freaking weirdo. France The most prosperous, cultured and beautiful nation in the world. As it had been, for centuries. An exquisite social culture, with the king and the upper classes throwing crazy parties every night, enjoying high living, and fine dining. Who cares if they were only able to do so off the backs of the hard-working, starving poor? What are they gonna do? Revolt?? They're only 80% of the population. No. Life in France is great. What's that France? You want to go to war with Britain and increase your power? Go for it, little buddy. You do you. Aaaaand you lost. (Britain kicks France out of North America) Now you're in severe financial debt. - We have no money. What do we do? - Should we stop partying? - Heck NO! Party HARDER! (Party randomly starts) That's ok. The peasantry will pick up the slack. They were created by God to do all the work, and you were created to reap all the benefits and party hard That's how society works, and we've all just accepted it for centuries. - Why? - Why what? *Beer splashes onto the poor man's face* -Why do the nobility get to be all rich and stuff? Just because they were born into it? And the rest of us shmucks just have to accept that? *spills some more beer* Hell, why do we even need a king? *spills even more beer* Who decided that? It all just seems very unfair and unequal and I, for one, am starting to question it. *spills the last bit of beer* (Soaked) - Wow. That's very enlightened of you. *burps* And so began the Age of Enlightenment. Great philosophical thinkers across France and beyond began to question whether this beautiful nation was really all that beautiful after all. - Hey Prince Louis. Bad news. Your grandpap died of smallpox this morning. Which means, GOOD NEWS You're now the king. So just to sum up: France is in severe financial debt and the angry populace are beginning to question how necessary you are. But hey! I believe in you, champ! You got this. (softly) maybe. -OOOoOoh NOoOoOo! Prince Louis Capet became King Louis XVI in May 1774. He was a notoriously weak man, and he knew it. He barely had the wisdom to rule a nation, never mind one in crisis. And he was easily manipulated by those around him. One of his first acts was to try to get revenge on the British by financing their American colonies' revolution. - Hey! We're an independent nation now. That was real swell of ya, Louis. Couldn't have done it without you. - Glad I could help. So hey, about all that money we lent you. When can we get that back? (proceeds to walk away) - Yep, you're a great guy! I'll never forget what you've done for us. - Real glad I could help friend but about that money-- (continues to walk away) - Gotta go now, chum. Best of luck to ya! - OOOoOh NOoOoOo! And now France was in even more debt. France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform.

France's poor, suffering under the strain of economic ruin, watched as the nobility continued to live as though nothing was wrong. *Intense partying* In particular, they grew increasingly disdainful of the queen, Marie Antoinette as she continued to spend all of France's money on her own luxurious lifestyle and fashion. While the peasants were breaking their backs in the fields, she was walking around like: - Hey. My hair is a boat. I'm not making that up. Her hair really was a boat. And her lavish spending earned her the nickname 'Madame Deficit.' And speaking of the queen, there was also a long standing scandal around the fact that the King took a very long time to boink her. And the working classes of Paris began ridiculing the royal couple with lewd pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court THOT and the King as a wuss unable to fulfill his marital duty. Respect for the monarchy was at an all time low as France's finances were spiralling out of control. And the King and his aides really only had one solution to the crisis. - Tax the poor. - We could do a sexy calendar shoot. Uh, I mean... Tax the poor... And so it was. The poor, who were already struggling to make ends meet found themselves being taxed from every direction. - Hey. I'm the royal tax collector. Looks like you've yet to pay your income tax, head tax, ... by the way, how many windows you got on that house of yours? - Ummm, three? - Oof, yep, there's gonna be a tax for that. - Hey, your local priest here. Have you paid your church tithe yet? - Well at least this one is going to the good work of God. - Sssssure, God. I think this year, God wants me to buy a new swimming pool. - Hey, private tax collector here. Oh, and I've brought some goons with me. Just a few quick questions... How much salt did you buy this year? - About 7 kilos, I think. - Yep ok, there's gonna be a tax for that. Oh! What's that over there? - That's extra salt I held over from last year so I wouldn't have to buy as much this year. - Ooh yeah, there's a tax for that. ummm... aaand... what are you doing with all of this salt? - Well, obviously cooking. - mmhmm - On the table. - yep. - And preserving fish and meat. (holds back laughter) -oh. Oh no, yep, there's a tax for that. (her son pops out of nowhere) Hey! How old is he? - He's 9. - And so he's purchased his required amount of salt for this year, right? - What? No, he's 9! - Uh-oh, sorry little Timmy. Looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for that. (Timmy starts crying) (Tax collector tastes his tears) - Yep, salty. There's gonna be a tax for that. And that's not all. A huge portion of the peasant's harvest had to be given up. And there was also the labour tax. Where peasants were required to work a certain number of days for their local lord without pay. Obviously, people weren't too happy with these taxation policies. And the aggressive nature of these private tax farmers sometimes even escalated to violence. In particular though, the people really hated how inconsistent the taxation rules were across the nation. And also the fact that the first two estates often had to pay very little, if any, tax at all. And so, the anger continued to grow. France had a population that was just about ready to explode. What could push them over the edge? How about a touch of natural disaster? A series of harsh summers and winters left the peasant's harvests in ruin. meaning they had no food or money. And the cost of bread skyrocketed. Of course, the upper classes had massive stocks of grain and wheat, so they were virtually untouched by this new crisis. But now the poor really were starving. And they began to riot. Women took to the streets. Bakeries were raided and bakers suspected of keeping bread for themselves were sometimes even hanged. - Wow. This is really getting out of control. - Your majesty, we need some decisive action. YOU need to step up and lead us. What will you do? - Ok, ok, I've got this... I KNOW! I'll summon the Estates General and they'll decide what to do. *silence* *gets angry* - You really are a fat, ill-bred boy. The Estates General was the closest thing France had to a government, apart from the king. It was a purely advisory body and was rarely summoned. In fact, it hadn't been summoned for 175 years prior to this. But with France in a severe crisis, the king felt the time was right to call in the government to help. The Estates General was made up of representatives from the three estates that is the Clergy, the Nobility, and everybody else. - Okay Thanks for coming, everyone. The first order of business is regarding the clergy and nobility You all get BRAND NEW PORCHES! You get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche! And YOU get a Porsche!!! EVERYBODY GETS A PORSCHE! And now onto the second order of business France is completely out of money Like- it's never been this bad before Anyone got any ideas? - How about we all get Lamborghinis next time? (massive applause) The king decided that in order to make a desicion they had to come up with a voting system. OK The clergy You have the population of a hundred and thirty thousand So you'll get one vote. The nobility You have the population of three hundred and fifty thousand so you'll also get one vote. And the third estate You have the population of twenty seven million people and make up ninty eight percent of the population VERY impressive! You'll get ... one vote. The third estate were obviously pretty unhappy with this system because they kept on finding that this would happen We propose to raise taxes on the third estate. All in favor? All opposed? Two to one! Taxes will be raised on the third estate. - We propose a motion that says the first two Estates are a bunch of poo-poo heads. - All in favour? - All opposed? Two to one! - It's official! We are NOT poo-poo heads. (massive applause) The Third Estate realised that any attempt at reform would be outvoted by the two upper estates. And they thought that was kind of lame. So they decided that since they were 98% of the population, they can go off to form their own government, make their own laws, and take over the running of the country. And so, the National Assembly was born. The Third Estate was now in control and there was nothing the king could do to stop-- - Haha! I've locked you out of your building. What are you gonna do about it? - We'll probably go find a different building that isn't locked. (roasted) - OOOoOoh NOoO-- The National Assembly did find another unlocked building, just down the road an indoor tennis court, where on 20 June 1789, they all took the Tennis Court Oath pledging to continue meeting until the King gave into their demands for more equality and economic reform. This new National Assembly included many of the most educated members of the Third Estate including two young lawyers by the names of Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton Some members of the first two estates even joined their cause. Some of these men formed a radical new political party called the Jacobin Club and quickly became leading figures while many members of the Third Estate simply wanted more equality. A growing number in this Jacobin faction would begin calling for something even crazier: The removal of the King entirely. And this is where FEAR began to take hold. With such a volatile situation developing, everyone was afraid of something. The King feared his position was under threat, and he called in the military to take position around Paris. The Third Estate heard rumour of the gathering military force and they feared the King was planning to round them up and arrest them. Maybe, he'd even execute them. It also didn't help that the King had just dismissed France's popular Finance Minister who had been trying to make reforms himself. It seemed, the King was done negotiating. Fear, left unchecked, often boils over into anger. And anger detonates with violence. The angry people of Paris, after centuries of cruel inequality, harsh oppression, even starvation, fearful of having their new movement for reform demolished so soon, decided that it was now or never to take action. Screw reform! They decided that they'd do one better. How about: REVOLUTION The people of Paris, believing the French Military was preparing to attack, decided they should arm themselves. The National Assembly announced the creation of a 'Bourgeois Militia'- The National Guard- -and immediately, many troops from the French Military defected over to the revolutionary side. In the early hours of July 14th, 1789, a large crowd stormed and raided the Hôtel les Invalides A military hospital, where they were able to secure a large number of rifles. The Bad News was- they weren't able to find any gunpowder for their new weapons. The Good News was- they knew exactly where to get some. A prison fortress, and a symbol of royal tyranny, towering over Paris: The Bastille. Midmorning, the crowd gathered around the Bastille, and demanded that the man in charge Governor de Launay, surrender the prison, and hand over the gunpowder. Obviously, Governor de Launay was like: 'No way!' So, he stalled for time by inviting a few members of the crowd in for negotiations. The crowd, still waiting outside, quickly became impatient and before long, they stormed the fortress, taking on the French troops inside. - Your Majesty, we've received word that the people have surrounded the Bastille - Governor de Launay will hold them off. No need to worry. - Aaaaactually, your Majesty, it appears the crowd is now headed away from the Bastille. - You see?! What did I tell ya! Clearly Governor de Launay has defeated them, and has them on the run. No need to worry. - Uh, your Majesty Isn't that Governor de Launay's head on a pike? - Well... Clearly, Governor de Launay has taken on the form of a bodyless, pike-head deity and the people are so enamored with him, they're parading him around the city. No need to worry AT ALL. (quickly drives away) When the National Assembly heard about the violence that had taken place, they had two options: either one, they denounce it, and try to carry on the Revolution using peaceful means, or two, they say: 'Damn, you stuck his head on a pike? That's pretty hardcore, and WE LOVE IT! Incidentally, they went with option #2. Some historians believe this reaction paved the way for the utter violence and bloodshed that would become the legacy of the French Revolution. This widespread acceptance of violence during the Revolution is also largely accredited to the writings of a certain Jean-Paul Marat. A man of science, with a horrible skin condition that kept him confined to a bathtub. He began writing a radical newspaper he affectionately named: 'The Friend of the People' - Citizens of France, be very afraid Given the chance, the King and the nobility won't hesitate to massacre us all. The solution is simple: EXECUTE THEM! Kill every last one of them! Cut off a thousand heads, and if that isn't enough, CUT OFF A THOUSAND MORE! (rubber duck rises) Oh! Hey Mr. Squeaky. What are you doing down there? You're so cute! (squeezes duck) Awwww, I love you too, Mr. Squeaky. (kisses duck) Now where was I? Oh yeah...... Kill them all It became one of the most popular publications in Paris during the revolution, and succeeded in spreading ever increasing fear and anger among the people. In August, leaders of the National Assembly, with help from a certain Thomas Jefferson, adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen- an incredible document that guaranteed liberty and equal rights to all men. And when I say men, I mean men. (not women) Despite its glaring shortcomings in gender equality, the massively influential Declaration would go on to inspire the struggle for liberty and equality across the planet for centuries. However, back in France, the vast majority of the people weren't really so concerned with enlightened ideas of equality as much as they were concerned with the fact that they were still starving. Bread was still expensive as hell and hard to come by. The people felt that one reason that nothing had been done yet about the crisis was because the King simply couldn't see the problem. He lived in Versailles, a full 20 km southwest of Paris. And as a result, lived in comfort, separated from his dirty, stinking subjects. On October 5, a crowd of women, 7,000 strong, decided to do something unprecedented. They decided they'd remove that separation, and confront the king directly. The women marched all the way to the King's palace in Versailles. Along the way, the crowd continued to grow into the tens of thousands. And when they arrived, they demanded an audience with the King. - What are those 'things' outside the palace? - They're poor people, your Majesty - THAT'S POOR PEOPLE?!! - They say they're hungry. - Hungry? Then let them eat cake. - Wow. See, this is the exact BS that led to this whole mess in the first place. You're SO out of touch. They're writhing around in the filth breaking their backs to barely scrape by and they come to you demanding just the basic ability to feed themselves and you think a slice of cake will sort them out? - Well... then let them eat Taco Bell Crunch Wrap Supreme. - Wow! They're not THAT desperate! Members of the crowd actually managed to break into the palace with the intention of killing the Queen who narrowly escaped through a secret passage in her bedroom. The enraged mob killed several members of the Royal guard, and raised their head on pikes, which if you haven't noticed yet, is something they were quite fond of doing. The King had no choice, but to come out and talk to the crowd. He agreed to accept his new position, sharing power with the Revolutionary government and to return to Paris with the crowd, removing the separation between King and Subject.

"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com. So, I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost. The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age-restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always count on YouTube monetization. So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component and this form of Zyklon B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust. (slow tense music) Thinking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain or as a hero for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would've figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air and other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it'd be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used. Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive. So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?","1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded.

But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. (models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com.

So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component and this form of Zyklon B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust. (slow tense music) Thinking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain or as a hero for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would've figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air and other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it'd be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used. Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive. So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?","In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands .

But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world.

(models clattering) I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago where all the atoms snapped together magnetically. So, you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released (atoms clicks) when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like real molecules and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatoms are for sale on Amazon and snatoms.com.

So, if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snatoms if you want some or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules. (models clattering) (thunder claps) There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy, it breaks apart in two into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides and these molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so, and they make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So, chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed nitrogen and hydrogen in a sealed flask trying to make ammonia, one of the nitrogen-containing molecules found in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure and that didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So, when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So, there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials. Like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence but the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs. So, they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there in the third week of March 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber and then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. An elated Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, 'Come on down. There's ammonia.' Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Oppau producing five tons of ammonia per day. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') People spoke of making bread from the air. ('Symphony No. 9 in D Minor') With the fertilizer from this industrial process on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food and as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. (wheat rustling) The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well-regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. (explosion booming) (crowd screaming) A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Oppau plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen. We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, (atoms clicks) a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. (gun popping) But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the institute into a chemical weapons laboratory and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, 'Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.' (somber music) At 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is 2 1/2 times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the Allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lung full of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. (somber music) More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. (somber music) Haber was promoted to the rank of captain. Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute researching chemical weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the institute employed 1,500 people including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan project but for chemical weapons. In total, 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the institute. (pensive music) The next year in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure. Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor so, they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component and this form of Zyklon B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust. (slow tense music) Thinking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain or as a hero for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would've figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air and other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it'd be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used. Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive. So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?","The 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded.

"- The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced. His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected their awards in protest and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time. (dramatic orchestral music) Perhaps more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. (dramatic orchestral music) (tense music) If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So, why did people want poop-covered islands so badly? (birds chirping) ('The Blue Danube') There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate and the waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot. ('The Blue Danube') Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or a hundred feet high. ('The Blue Danube') And technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s, buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So, why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants, and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it and eventually there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially, for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil which is where bird guano comes in. (rhythmic music) Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872 guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix. (tense music) This was a crisis. William Crooks, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, 'We stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat.' In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation, but he also proposed a solution. 'It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.' Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen but it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So, to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take 2 1/2 electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 eV. Two oxygens, 5.2 eV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy.

" These are the 7 most powerful men in China. They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party... and their identities are revealed every five years... at a carefully choreographed political event called the National Congress. “China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership over the next five years.” The order of appearance is symbolic. The first person to emerge is the head of the party for the next five years. At the most recent event in October 2022... that person was Xi Jinping China's president for the last ten years... who walked out in the top spot a historic third time after getting rid of China's presidential term limit that restricted all his predecessors to two terms. A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life. The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this since Mao Zedong... the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China... whose ruthless dictatorship scarred the Chinese people for generations. Xi has been compared to Mao a lot. And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook. But there's something else that connects these two. When Xi was just a young boy... Mao ruined his life. Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing... ended up in exile. Condemned to hard labor in the countryside. 50 years later Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world and the only leader since Mao to have unchecked power over China. So how did he go from being banished in his country... to taking complete control of it?   Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed long before Xi was even born.  It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China. A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao gained influence over large swaths of mainland China... and controlled a communist military called the Red Army... that fought the Nationalist Party ruling the Republic of China at the time. At this point, the Communists were losing bad. The bulk of their army was pinned down here... in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao... now surrounded by Nationalist forces. And they were running low on food. So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack... to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly 130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here. On October 16th, 1934, they made their move... and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line. They broke through. And even though their numbers quickly dropped with thousands dying and thousands more fleeing to the countryside... around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on. This was the beginning of a year-long historic retreat called the Long March. The journey to establish a new communist base... far from the Nationalist forces. Mao, who used to be a military leader wasn't in charge at this time. He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war. But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted. The Long March changed that. After escaping the siege here the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks by the pursuing Nationalist army. The military leaders of the march had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy of direct confrontation... rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics. And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army. Less than half of the original escape group survived the first three months alone. So it was at this first stopping point where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai... handed military leadership back to Mao. And Mao picked an end point for the march... here. 800 miles away in rural northern China. But they didn't go straight for it. Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains where he predicted lighter resistance. And he was right. But the journey was still brutal. It was nine more months of nonstop marching and fighting along this several thousand mile route... before they ultimately arrived in northern China... where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge... bringing the Long March to an end. That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works. Officially, the highest level of authority is a group called the Central Committee and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions. Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials called the Political Bureau or Politburo. In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union... the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party besides the General Secretary. But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction that makes it unique. It has one more even smaller selection of top officials who ultimately have the final say. An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee. This group, which includes the General Secretary holds supreme control over the Central Committee dictates the will of the party and is in full control of the Central Military Commission which oversees China's defense. Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here in the highest position of the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party when the Long March ended in 1935... he officially became head of the party in 1943. With both the party and the military under his control... Mao began to exploit the system to ensure he remained at the top for the rest of his life. At Mao's first National Congress as the official party leader in 1945... the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence to a whole new level. They unified the party around a single understanding of its history... and declared Mao's political ideology later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism... as the unquestioned guiding principle of the Chinese Communist Party. Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions could no longer be challenged by anyone. It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time of the Politburo Standing Committee. The four other top party leaders... all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao. Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai... who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions in the future government. Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists in a decades long Chinese civil war and established a new country: The People's Republic of China, or PRC. “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker... now assumed the stature of a dominant figure in all of Eastern Asia.” But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country. Because now that you're running a country there's all these other things you have to do like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that. You can't possibly have the party do all these things. So the party set up a government that would take the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee and figure out a way to make them a reality. And so it evolved to a system where... the party would make all the important decisions... and especially the Politburo Standing Committee. Then, as it is today... many of these decisions would go to the State Council. So the State Council was the highest decision-making body on the state side, led by the Premier of China. The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions in the party in government. Whether they had government experience or not. For example, Zhou Enlai... the former party leader who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March... became China's first premier. The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him. The disadvantage of that is they didn't know what they were doing and so administration suffered... policy outcomes suffered. Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao. Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed Secretary General of the State Council... and as the son of a Long Marcher young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling. Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime. His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines and widespread persecution that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades... and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution. A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism. The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal. The way he viewed communist figureheads like Lenin and Marx before him. Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology was publicly humiliated... impoverished... excluded from society, and, in many cases executed. Either at the hands of the army... or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism: The Red Guards.  Even those closest to the dictator weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution. High level officials including members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Long Marchers... were removed from their positions. Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died while imprisoned under harsh conditions. Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army and replaced him with a Maoist... leaving no one left to oppose him in the military. Mao's handpicked successor who always appeared loyally by his side in photos and propaganda posters died under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union. Mao later denounced him as a traitor. He denounced Xi's father, too. This is a photo of Xi senior being restrained and publicly criticized by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution. He would remain a prisoner in Beijing for 8 years following this. With his father purged... Xi Jinping, 15 at the time was expelled from his elite school in Beijing and sent to work in the countryside. He had to live in a cave and do hard manual labor. His food was barely enough for a growing young person. And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it. But then... Mao died. The Cultural Revolution ended. His successor was Deng Xiaoping... one of the Politburo Standing Committee members who was removed from power during the Cultural Revolution. Who just before Mao died... started making a promise to fellow exiled party veterans. Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly... to all the surviving Long Marchers that he wanted to rehabilitate people. So when Mao died, they all supported the rehabilitation of Deng. And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated he went ahead and rehabilitated all these people. With experienced leadership back in place the party needed to figure out how to prevent something like this... from ever happening again. In order to undo Mao's cult of personality... the party introduced a second historical resolution in 1981. It condemned periods of Mao's rule... and emphasized a renewed commitment to collective leadership... vowing to oppose the consolidation of power around one person moving forward. The successors to Mao didn't want a dictatorship. So they divided up these positions and put them in the hands of different people. Like Mao, Deng kept tight control over the Central Military Commission as its chairman... and held a leadership position in the government. But was never head of state. He never held the highest position in the party either. Instead, he set up a new advisory commission and served as its chairman... which allowed him to influence the party's direction... without positioning himself directly on top of it. This allowed a power sharing structure while still making Deng the de facto leader of China until he stepped down in 1989... following the Army's massacre of students protesting in Tiananmen Square. “A protester suddenly ran into the middle of the street and in front of the oncoming tanks.” “Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire Chinese government... it had the real feeling of rebellion in the streets of Beijing.” “People want to fight the military out of their city.” Deng and his ideology which moved away from Maoism, set a precedent of sharing power. He opened up China and established economic ties with these countries... and was the first PRC leader to visit the US in 1979. “Today, we take another step in the historic... normalization of relations which we have begun this year.” Deng’s reforms became the foundation for decades of economic prosperity that led China to having the world's second largest economy over time... and being on the verge of becoming the world's next superpower. “Communism is creating a consumer society.” “Also reminds you that the standard of living in China is going up.” “Here... capitalism rules.” One thing power sharing did lead to... was a lot of policy innovation and then some degree of decentralization. And both of these things helped China's economy enormously. Which is why this period of economic growth and reform stretching over roughly 30 years is known as the Deng era. Whether he wanted to or not, Deng kept his word... and never tried to consolidate absolute power around himself. He did end up sharing power. And that set the stage for power sharing in the party... until the rise of Xi Jinping. So what was Xi doing all this time?  When Mao died in 1976 Xi was back in Beijing studying communist philosophy... even though the Chinese Communist Party had ruined Xi's family... He had joined it. Just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. But why? Personally, he might begrudge Chairman Mao for doing all this terrible things to his family... but I think at this time he also recognized that in the system of the Chinese Communist Party power is everything. Without power, you're nothing. But in order to get that power... Xi did something unexpected. He left Beijing. As his competitors were fiercely competing with each other in the 1980s and 1990s. He sort of got out of their way... and went to the provinces. He took positions in party leadership in rural, poor provinces all around China... where there were no other princelings to compete with. First, in Hebei, a poor rural province outside of Beijing... where he easily reached the top spot as party secretary. Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region where top members of the army were stationed. He moved up the ranks to party secretary here, too. Before becoming the governor of the province a few years later. After making powerful friends in the military... Xi went here... where he once again assumes the office of party secretary... and grew his support on the civilian side. This strategy of moving around didn't just give Xi a leg up in areas where competition was slim. It also gave him credibility... as a humble, hard working party leader... and he cultivated a growing group of supporters who would come back into play years down the line. It was his last stop and his shortest one that ultimately got him back to Beijing. A brief stint in the top party spot in Shanghai in 2007... where he rehabilitated the city's image following a high-level corruption scandal. Xi developed a reputation here as a prudent leader who toed the party line. Just 7 months later, he finally returned to Beijing... having been promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Basically, the people who were deciding on top leadership at the time they wanted a Princeling. But they didn't want a princeling who was too ambitious or too strong. So Xi Jinping he was seen as less ambitious because he was willing to go to the countryside and work in lower-level positions. When Xi emerged as the 2007 National Congress and leadership unveiling... he was one of the 9 most powerful men in the country. It was at this moment that his strategic climb... over 17 long years in the countryside paid off. Big time. When the General Secretary stepped down in 2012... Xi emerged at the top spot in the party as China's leader. Now the elite son of a former revolutionary turned exiled peasant... turned party darling... was poised to seize control of everything. Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes that rallying around a single figure is crucial to the party's survival. Rather than the collective leadership Deng’s reforms had normalized. So pretty much as soon as Xi Jinping came to power. He started getting rid of people. “The news... four top officials removed for taking bribes was announced on state TV.” “Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.” “Just sacked his defense minister.” “He sacked a whole lot of other people at the top of the military establishment.” “The former security czar has not been seen in public for more than a year.” “The nvestigation against Zhou allows the Chinese president to remove those opposed to his reforms.” He launched a major anti-corruption campaign... as soon as he took power in late 2012, early ‘13... which led to the arrests of hundreds of senior-level officials as well as military officers. These purges targeted Xi's rivals in the party... whose vacant positions he filled with his own supporters. After this massive purge... Xi Jinping was in very tight control over both the party and also the Chinese military... thereby making him the most powerful leader of the Chinese Communist Party since the death of Mao. That pattern continued in the second term where he unveiled 5 new faces of the Politburo Standing Committee... three of them with close personal ties to Xi. In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his most dramatic acts yet... to enforce his influence over the Chinese Communist Party. He introduced a third historic resolution that unified the party's ideology around one clear line of thinking: Xi Jinping Thought. Xi's personal political ideology... would now be the core in the party's thinking... political stance and action. Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas could no longer be challenged. And they weren't for many years. During Xi's first 10 years in power the size of China's economy more than doubled. So did average individual income. So did military spending. Under his leadership... China's presence on the world stage has grown too. Positioning the rising superpower to take on the role of an aggressor, externally. Reasserting claims over parts of the South China Sea Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet and stripping democratic process in Hong Kong. Inside its own borders strict Internet censorship and surveillance are widespread... and oppression of Uyghurs... a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group... is marked by human rights abuses. But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw the first real challenge to his authority. “Anger in China is growing.” “Video showing protester is in Xinjiang... fed up with China's zero Covid rules.” “The boldest public challenge yet for leader Xi Jinping.” With these protests all around the country... and the party's reputation in peril. Xi reversed the failed policy. But is now faced with a shaky economy... and cracks in his unchecked authority. It was just weeks before the widespread protests at the 20th National Congress in 2022... that Xi walked out in the leading position a third time. He had already locked in the presidency for another five years... and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee completely packed with those loyal to him. After removing the final senior members of the party that had ties to his predecessor. Now there is no one left in party or military leadership whose ideology differs from Xi. I don't think anyone can push him out at this point. I think Xi will be the most powerful leader in China... as long as he's alive and conscious. Thanks so much for watching this episode of Atlas.

" These are the 7 most powerful men in China. They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party... and their identities are revealed every five years... at a carefully choreographed political event called the National Congress. “China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership over the next five years.” The order of appearance is symbolic. The first person to emerge is the head of the party for the next five years. At the most recent event in October 2022... that person was Xi Jinping China's president for the last ten years... who walked out in the top spot a historic third time after getting rid of China's presidential term limit that restricted all his predecessors to two terms. A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life. The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this since Mao Zedong... the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China... whose ruthless dictatorship scarred the Chinese people for generations. Xi has been compared to Mao a lot. And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook. But there's something else that connects these two. When Xi was just a young boy... Mao ruined his life. Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing... ended up in exile. Condemned to hard labor in the countryside. 50 years later Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world and the only leader since Mao to have unchecked power over China. So how did he go from being banished in his country... to taking complete control of it?   Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed long before Xi was even born.  It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China. A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao gained influence over large swaths of mainland China... and controlled a communist military called the Red Army... that fought the Nationalist Party ruling the Republic of China at the time. At this point, the Communists were losing bad. The bulk of their army was pinned down here... in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao... now surrounded by Nationalist forces. And they were running low on food. So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack... to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly 130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here. On October 16th, 1934, they made their move... and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line. They broke through. And even though their numbers quickly dropped with thousands dying and thousands more fleeing to the countryside... around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on. This was the beginning of a year-long historic retreat called the Long March. The journey to establish a new communist base... far from the Nationalist forces. Mao, who used to be a military leader wasn't in charge at this time. He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war. But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted. The Long March changed that. After escaping the siege here the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks by the pursuing Nationalist army. The military leaders of the march had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy of direct confrontation... rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics. And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army. Less than half of the original escape group survived the first three months alone. So it was at this first stopping point where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai... handed military leadership back to Mao. And Mao picked an end point for the march... here. 800 miles away in rural northern China. But they didn't go straight for it. Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains where he predicted lighter resistance. And he was right. But the journey was still brutal. It was nine more months of nonstop marching and fighting along this several thousand mile route... before they ultimately arrived in northern China... where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge... bringing the Long March to an end. That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works. Officially, the highest level of authority is a group called the Central Committee and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions. Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials called the Political Bureau or Politburo. In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union... the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party besides the General Secretary. But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction that makes it unique. It has one more even smaller selection of top officials who ultimately have the final say. An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee. This group, which includes the General Secretary holds supreme control over the Central Committee dictates the will of the party and is in full control of the Central Military Commission which oversees China's defense. Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here in the highest position of the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party when the Long March ended in 1935... he officially became head of the party in 1943. With both the party and the military under his control... Mao began to exploit the system to ensure he remained at the top for the rest of his life. At Mao's first National Congress as the official party leader in 1945... the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence to a whole new level. They unified the party around a single understanding of its history... and declared Mao's political ideology later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism... as the unquestioned guiding principle of the Chinese Communist Party. Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions could no longer be challenged by anyone. It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time of the Politburo Standing Committee. The four other top party leaders... all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao. Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai... who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions in the future government. Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists in a decades long Chinese civil war and established a new country: The People's Republic of China, or PRC. “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker... now assumed the stature of a dominant figure in all of Eastern Asia.” But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country. Because now that you're running a country there's all these other things you have to do like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that. You can't possibly have the party do all these things. So the party set up a government that would take the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee and figure out a way to make them a reality. And so it evolved to a system where... the party would make all the important decisions... and especially the Politburo Standing Committee. Then, as it is today... many of these decisions would go to the State Council. So the State Council was the highest decision-making body on the state side, led by the Premier of China. The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions in the party in government. Whether they had government experience or not. For example, Zhou Enlai... the former party leader who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March... became China's first premier. The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him. The disadvantage of that is they didn't know what they were doing and so administration suffered... policy outcomes suffered. Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao. Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed Secretary General of the State Council... and as the son of a Long Marcher young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling. Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime. His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines and widespread persecution that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades... and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution. A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism. The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal. The way he viewed communist figureheads like Lenin and Marx before him. Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology was publicly humiliated... impoverished... excluded from society, and, in many cases executed. Either at the hands of the army... or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism: The Red Guards.  Even those closest to the dictator weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution. High level officials including members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Long Marchers... were removed from their positions. Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died while imprisoned under harsh conditions. Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army and replaced him with a Maoist... leaving no one left to oppose him in the military. Mao's handpicked successor who always appeared loyally by his side in photos and propaganda posters died under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union.

That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works. Officially, the highest level of authority is a group called the Central Committee and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions. Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials called the Political Bureau or Politburo. In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union... the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party besides the General Secretary. But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction that makes it unique. It has one more even smaller selection of top officials who ultimately have the final say. An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee. This group, which includes the General Secretary holds supreme control over the Central Committee dictates the will of the party and is in full control of the Central Military Commission which oversees China's defense. Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here in the highest position of the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party when the Long March ended in 1935... he officially became head of the party in 1943. With both the party and the military under his control... Mao began to exploit the system to ensure he remained at the top for the rest of his life. At Mao's first National Congress as the official party leader in 1945... the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence to a whole new level. They unified the party around a single understanding of its history... and declared Mao's political ideology later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism... as the unquestioned guiding principle of the Chinese Communist Party. Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions could no longer be challenged by anyone. It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time of the Politburo Standing Committee. The four other top party leaders... all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao. Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai... who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions in the future government. Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists in a decades long Chinese civil war and established a new country: The People's Republic of China, or PRC. “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker... now assumed the stature of a dominant figure in all of Eastern Asia.” But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country. Because now that you're running a country there's all these other things you have to do like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that. You can't possibly have the party do all these things. So the party set up a government that would take the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee and figure out a way to make them a reality. And so it evolved to a system where... the party would make all the important decisions... and especially the Politburo Standing Committee. Then, as it is today... many of these decisions would go to the State Council. So the State Council was the highest decision-making body on the state side, led by the Premier of China. The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions in the party in government. Whether they had government experience or not. For example, Zhou Enlai... the former party leader who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March... became China's first premier. The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him. The disadvantage of that is they didn't know what they were doing and so administration suffered... policy outcomes suffered. Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao. Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed Secretary General of the State Council... and as the son of a Long Marcher young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling. Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime. His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines and widespread persecution that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades... and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution. A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism. The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal. The way he viewed communist figureheads like Lenin and Marx before him. Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology was publicly humiliated... impoverished... excluded from society, and, in many cases executed. Either at the hands of the army... or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism: The Red Guards.  Even those closest to the dictator weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution. High level officials including members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Long Marchers... were removed from their positions. Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died while imprisoned under harsh conditions. Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army and replaced him with a Maoist... leaving no one left to oppose him in the military. Mao's handpicked successor who always appeared loyally by his side in photos and propaganda posters died under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union. Mao later denounced him as a traitor. He denounced Xi's father, too. This is a photo of Xi senior being restrained and publicly criticized by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution. He would remain a prisoner in Beijing for 8 years following this. With his father purged... Xi Jinping, 15 at the time was expelled from his elite school in Beijing and sent to work in the countryside. He had to live in a cave and do hard manual labor. His food was barely enough for a growing young person. And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it. But then... Mao died. The Cultural Revolution ended. His successor was Deng Xiaoping... one of the Politburo Standing Committee members who was removed from power during the Cultural Revolution. Who just before Mao died... started making a promise to fellow exiled party veterans. Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly... to all the surviving Long Marchers that he wanted to rehabilitate people. So when Mao died, they all supported the rehabilitation of Deng. And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated he went ahead and rehabilitated all these people. With experienced leadership back in place the party needed to figure out how to prevent something like this... from ever happening again. In order to undo Mao's cult of personality... the party introduced a second historical resolution in 1981. It condemned periods of Mao's rule... and emphasized a renewed commitment to collective leadership... vowing to oppose the consolidation of power around one person moving forward. The successors to Mao didn't want a dictatorship. So they divided up these positions and put them in the hands of different people. Like Mao, Deng kept tight control over the Central Military Commission as its chairman... and held a leadership position in the government. But was never head of state. He never held the highest position in the party either. Instead, he set up a new advisory commission and served as its chairman... which allowed him to influence the party's direction... without positioning himself directly on top of it. This allowed a power sharing structure while still making Deng the de facto leader of China until he stepped down in 1989... following the Army's massacre of students protesting in Tiananmen Square. “A protester suddenly ran into the middle of the street and in front of the oncoming tanks.” “Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire Chinese government... it had the real feeling of rebellion in the streets of Beijing.” “People want to fight the military out of their city.” Deng and his ideology which moved away from Maoism, set a precedent of sharing power. He opened up China and established economic ties with these countries... and was the first PRC leader to visit the US in 1979. “Today, we take another step in the historic... normalization of relations which we have begun this year.” Deng’s reforms became the foundation for decades of economic prosperity that led China to having the world's second largest economy over time... and being on the verge of becoming the world's next superpower. “Communism is creating a consumer society.” “Also reminds you that the standard of living in China is going up.” “Here... capitalism rules.” One thing power sharing did lead to... was a lot of policy innovation and then some degree of decentralization. And both of these things helped China's economy enormously. Which is why this period of economic growth and reform stretching over roughly 30 years is known as the Deng era. Whether he wanted to or not, Deng kept his word... and never tried to consolidate absolute power around himself. He did end up sharing power. And that set the stage for power sharing in the party... until the rise of Xi Jinping. So what was Xi doing all this time?  When Mao died in 1976 Xi was back in Beijing studying communist philosophy... even though the Chinese Communist Party had ruined Xi's family... He had joined it. Just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. But why? Personally, he might begrudge Chairman Mao for doing all this terrible things to his family... but I think at this time he also recognized that in the system of the Chinese Communist Party power is everything. Without power, you're nothing. But in order to get that power... Xi did something unexpected. He left Beijing. As his competitors were fiercely competing with each other in the 1980s and 1990s. He sort of got out of their way... and went to the provinces. He took positions in party leadership in rural, poor provinces all around China... where there were no other princelings to compete with. First, in Hebei, a poor rural province outside of Beijing... where he easily reached the top spot as party secretary. Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region where top members of the army were stationed. He moved up the ranks to party secretary here, too. Before becoming the governor of the province a few years later. After making powerful friends in the military... Xi went here... where he once again assumes the office of party secretary... and grew his support on the civilian side. This strategy of moving around didn't just give Xi a leg up in areas where competition was slim. It also gave him credibility... as a humble, hard working party leader... and he cultivated a growing group of supporters who would come back into play years down the line. It was his last stop and his shortest one that ultimately got him back to Beijing. A brief stint in the top party spot in Shanghai in 2007... where he rehabilitated the city's image following a high-level corruption scandal. Xi developed a reputation here as a prudent leader who toed the party line. Just 7 months later, he finally returned to Beijing... having been promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Basically, the people who were deciding on top leadership at the time they wanted a Princeling. But they didn't want a princeling who was too ambitious or too strong. So Xi Jinping he was seen as less ambitious because he was willing to go to the countryside and work in lower-level positions. When Xi emerged as the 2007 National Congress and leadership unveiling... he was one of the 9 most powerful men in the country. It was at this moment that his strategic climb... over 17 long years in the countryside paid off. Big time. When the General Secretary stepped down in 2012... Xi emerged at the top spot in the party as China's leader. Now the elite son of a former revolutionary turned exiled peasant... turned party darling... was poised to seize control of everything. Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes that rallying around a single figure is crucial to the party's survival. Rather than the collective leadership Deng’s reforms had normalized. So pretty much as soon as Xi Jinping came to power. He started getting rid of people. “The news... four top officials removed for taking bribes was announced on state TV.” “Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.” “Just sacked his defense minister.” “He sacked a whole lot of other people at the top of the military establishment.” “The former security czar has not been seen in public for more than a year.” “The nvestigation against Zhou allows the Chinese president to remove those opposed to his reforms.” He launched a major anti-corruption campaign... as soon as he took power in late 2012, early ‘13... which led to the arrests of hundreds of senior-level officials as well as military officers. These purges targeted Xi's rivals in the party... whose vacant positions he filled with his own supporters. After this massive purge... Xi Jinping was in very tight control over both the party and also the Chinese military... thereby making him the most powerful leader of the Chinese Communist Party since the death of Mao. That pattern continued in the second term where he unveiled 5 new faces of the Politburo Standing Committee... three of them with close personal ties to Xi. In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his most dramatic acts yet... to enforce his influence over the Chinese Communist Party. He introduced a third historic resolution that unified the party's ideology around one clear line of thinking: Xi Jinping Thought. Xi's personal political ideology... would now be the core in the party's thinking... political stance and action. Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas could no longer be challenged. And they weren't for many years. During Xi's first 10 years in power the size of China's economy more than doubled. So did average individual income. So did military spending. Under his leadership... China's presence on the world stage has grown too. Positioning the rising superpower to take on the role of an aggressor, externally. Reasserting claims over parts of the South China Sea Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet and stripping democratic process in Hong Kong. Inside its own borders strict Internet censorship and surveillance are widespread... and oppression of Uyghurs... a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group... is marked by human rights abuses. But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw the first real challenge to his authority. “Anger in China is growing.” “Video showing protester is in Xinjiang... fed up with China's zero Covid rules.” “The boldest public challenge yet for leader Xi Jinping.” With these protests all around the country... and the party's reputation in peril. Xi reversed the failed policy. But is now faced with a shaky economy... and cracks in his unchecked authority. It was just weeks before the widespread protests at the 20th National Congress in 2022... that Xi walked out in the leading position a third time. He had already locked in the presidency for another five years... and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee completely packed with those loyal to him. After removing the final senior members of the party that had ties to his predecessor. Now there is no one left in party or military leadership whose ideology differs from Xi. I don't think anyone can push him out at this point. I think Xi will be the most powerful leader in China... as long as he's alive and conscious. Thanks so much for watching this episode of Atlas.

" These are the 7 most powerful men in China. They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party... and their identities are revealed every five years... at a carefully choreographed political event called the National Congress. “China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership over the next five years.” The order of appearance is symbolic. The first person to emerge is the head of the party for the next five years. At the most recent event in October 2022... that person was Xi Jinping China's president for the last ten years... who walked out in the top spot a historic third time after getting rid of China's presidential term limit that restricted all his predecessors to two terms. A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life. The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this since Mao Zedong... the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China... whose ruthless dictatorship scarred the Chinese people for generations. Xi has been compared to Mao a lot. And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook. But there's something else that connects these two. When Xi was just a young boy... Mao ruined his life. Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing... ended up in exile. Condemned to hard labor in the countryside. 50 years later Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world and the only leader since Mao to have unchecked power over China. So how did he go from being banished in his country... to taking complete control of it?   Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed long before Xi was even born.  It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China. A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao gained influence over large swaths of mainland China... and controlled a communist military called the Red Army... that fought the Nationalist Party ruling the Republic of China at the time. At this point, the Communists were losing bad. The bulk of their army was pinned down here... in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao... now surrounded by Nationalist forces. And they were running low on food. So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack... to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly 130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here. On October 16th, 1934, they made their move... and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line. They broke through. And even though their numbers quickly dropped with thousands dying and thousands more fleeing to the countryside... around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on. This was the beginning of a year-long historic retreat called the Long March. The journey to establish a new communist base... far from the Nationalist forces. Mao, who used to be a military leader wasn't in charge at this time. He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war. But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted. The Long March changed that. After escaping the siege here the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks by the pursuing Nationalist army. The military leaders of the march had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy of direct confrontation... rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics. And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army. Less than half of the original escape group survived the first three months alone. So it was at this first stopping point where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai... handed military leadership back to Mao. And Mao picked an end point for the march... here. 800 miles away in rural northern China. But they didn't go straight for it. Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains where he predicted lighter resistance. And he was right. But the journey was still brutal. It was nine more months of nonstop marching and fighting along this several thousand mile route... before they ultimately arrived in northern China... where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge... bringing the Long March to an end. That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works.

" These are the 7 most powerful men in China. They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party... and their identities are revealed every five years... at a carefully choreographed political event called the National Congress. “China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership over the next five years.” The order of appearance is symbolic. The first person to emerge is the head of the party for the next five years. At the most recent event in October 2022... that person was Xi Jinping China's president for the last ten years... who walked out in the top spot a historic third time after getting rid of China's presidential term limit that restricted all his predecessors to two terms. A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life. The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this since Mao Zedong... the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China... whose ruthless dictatorship scarred the Chinese people for generations. Xi has been compared to Mao a lot. And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook. But there's something else that connects these two. When Xi was just a young boy... Mao ruined his life. Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing... ended up in exile. Condemned to hard labor in the countryside. 50 years later Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world and the only leader since Mao to have unchecked power over China. So how did he go from being banished in his country... to taking complete control of it?   Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed long before Xi was even born.  It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China. A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao gained influence over large swaths of mainland China... and controlled a communist military called the Red Army... that fought the Nationalist Party ruling the Republic of China at the time. At this point, the Communists were losing bad. The bulk of their army was pinned down here... in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao... now surrounded by Nationalist forces. And they were running low on food. So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack... to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly 130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here. On October 16th, 1934, they made their move... and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line. They broke through. And even though their numbers quickly dropped with thousands dying and thousands more fleeing to the countryside... around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on. This was the beginning of a year-long historic retreat called the Long March. The journey to establish a new communist base... far from the Nationalist forces. Mao, who used to be a military leader wasn't in charge at this time. He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war. But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted. The Long March changed that. After escaping the siege here the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks by the pursuing Nationalist army. The military leaders of the march had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy of direct confrontation... rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics. And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army. Less than half of the original escape group survived the first three months alone. So it was at this first stopping point where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai... handed military leadership back to Mao. And Mao picked an end point for the march... here. 800 miles away in rural northern China. But they didn't go straight for it. Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains where he predicted lighter resistance. And he was right. But the journey was still brutal. It was nine more months of nonstop marching and fighting along this several thousand mile route... before they ultimately arrived in northern China... where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge... bringing the Long March to an end. That man was Xi Jinping's father. In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived. Even though thousands died on the Long March from starvation and fighting and disease... Mao's leadership was credited with saving the Red Army from total annihilation. And he became the de facto head of the party as well as the military... entrusted with rebuilding the army to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China. “Wherever and however... the Red Troops move into battle... they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.” This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works. Officially, the highest level of authority is a group called the Central Committee and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions. Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials called the Political Bureau or Politburo. In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union... the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party besides the General Secretary. But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction that makes it unique. It has one more even smaller selection of top officials who ultimately have the final say. An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee. This group, which includes the General Secretary holds supreme control over the Central Committee dictates the will of the party and is in full control of the Central Military Commission which oversees China's defense. Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here in the highest position of the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party when the Long March ended in 1935... he officially became head of the party in 1943. With both the party and the military under his control... Mao began to exploit the system to ensure he remained at the top for the rest of his life. At Mao's first National Congress as the official party leader in 1945... the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence to a whole new level. They unified the party around a single understanding of its history... and declared Mao's political ideology later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism... as the unquestioned guiding principle of the Chinese Communist Party. Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions could no longer be challenged by anyone. It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time of the Politburo Standing Committee. The four other top party leaders... all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao. Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai... who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions in the future government. Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists in a decades long Chinese civil war and established a new country: The People's Republic of China, or PRC. “Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker... now assumed the stature of a dominant figure in all of Eastern Asia.” But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country. Because now that you're running a country there's all these other things you have to do like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that. You can't possibly have the party do all these things. So the party set up a government that would take the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee and figure out a way to make them a reality. And so it evolved to a system where... the party would make all the important decisions... and especially the Politburo Standing Committee. Then, as it is today... many of these decisions would go to the State Council. So the State Council was the highest decision-making body on the state side, led by the Premier of China. The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions in the party in government. Whether they had government experience or not. For example, Zhou Enlai... the former party leader who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March... became China's first premier. The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him. The disadvantage of that is they didn't know what they were doing and so administration suffered... policy outcomes suffered. Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao. Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed Secretary General of the State Council... and as the son of a Long Marcher young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling. Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime. His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines and widespread persecution that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades... and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution. A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism. The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal. The way he viewed communist figureheads like Lenin and Marx before him. Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology was publicly humiliated... impoverished... excluded from society, and, in many cases executed. Either at the hands of the army... or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism: The Red Guards.  Even those closest to the dictator weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution. High level officials including members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Long Marchers... were removed from their positions. Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died while imprisoned under harsh conditions. Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army and replaced him with a Maoist... leaving no one left to oppose him in the military. Mao's handpicked successor who always appeared loyally by his side in photos and propaganda posters died under mysterious circumstances when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union. Mao later denounced him as a traitor. He denounced Xi's father, too. This is a photo of Xi senior being restrained and publicly criticized by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution. He would remain a prisoner in Beijing for 8 years following this. With his father purged... Xi Jinping, 15 at the time was expelled from his elite school in Beijing and sent to work in the countryside. He had to live in a cave and do hard manual labor. His food was barely enough for a growing young person. And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it. But then... Mao died. The Cultural Revolution ended. His successor was Deng Xiaoping... one of the Politburo Standing Committee members who was removed from power during the Cultural Revolution. Who just before Mao died... started making a promise to fellow exiled party veterans. Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly... to all the surviving Long Marchers that he wanted to rehabilitate people. So when Mao died, they all supported the rehabilitation of Deng. And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated he went ahead and rehabilitated all these people. With experienced leadership back in place the party needed to figure out how to prevent something like this... from ever happening again. In order to undo Mao's cult of personality... the party introduced a second historical resolution in 1981. It condemned periods of Mao's rule... and emphasized a renewed commitment to collective leadership... vowing to oppose the consolidation of power around one person moving forward. The successors to Mao didn't want a dictatorship. So they divided up these positions and put them in the hands of different people. Like Mao, Deng kept tight control over the Central Military Commission as its chairman... and held a leadership position in the government. But was never head of state. He never held the highest position in the party either. Instead, he set up a new advisory commission and served as its chairman... which allowed him to influence the party's direction... without positioning himself directly on top of it. This allowed a power sharing structure while still making Deng the de facto leader of China until he stepped down in 1989... following the Army's massacre of students protesting in Tiananmen Square. “A protester suddenly ran into the middle of the street and in front of the oncoming tanks.” “Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire Chinese government... it had the real feeling of rebellion in the streets of Beijing.” “People want to fight the military out of their city.” Deng and his ideology which moved away from Maoism, set a precedent of sharing power. He opened up China and established economic ties with these countries... and was the first PRC leader to visit the US in 1979. “Today, we take another step in the historic... normalization of relations which we have begun this year.” Deng’s reforms became the foundation for decades of economic prosperity that led China to having the world's second largest economy over time... and being on the verge of becoming the world's next superpower. “Communism is creating a consumer society.” “Also reminds you that the standard of living in China is going up.” “Here... capitalism rules.” One thing power sharing did lead to... was a lot of policy innovation and then some degree of decentralization. And both of these things helped China's economy enormously. Which is why this period of economic growth and reform stretching over roughly 30 years is known as the Deng era. Whether he wanted to or not, Deng kept his word... and never tried to consolidate absolute power around himself. He did end up sharing power. And that set the stage for power sharing in the party... until the rise of Xi Jinping. So what was Xi doing all this time?  When Mao died in 1976 Xi was back in Beijing studying communist philosophy... even though the Chinese Communist Party had ruined Xi's family... He had joined it. Just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. But why? Personally, he might begrudge Chairman Mao for doing all this terrible things to his family... but I think at this time he also recognized that in the system of the Chinese Communist Party power is everything. Without power, you're nothing. But in order to get that power... Xi did something unexpected. He left Beijing. As his competitors were fiercely competing with each other in the 1980s and 1990s. He sort of got out of their way... and went to the provinces. He took positions in party leadership in rural, poor provinces all around China... where there were no other princelings to compete with. First, in Hebei, a poor rural province outside of Beijing... where he easily reached the top spot as party secretary. Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region where top members of the army were stationed. He moved up the ranks to party secretary here, too. Before becoming the governor of the province a few years later. After making powerful friends in the military... Xi went here... where he once again assumes the office of party secretary... and grew his support on the civilian side. This strategy of moving around didn't just give Xi a leg up in areas where competition was slim. It also gave him credibility... as a humble, hard working party leader... and he cultivated a growing group of supporters who would come back into play years down the line. It was his last stop and his shortest one that ultimately got him back to Beijing. A brief stint in the top party spot in Shanghai in 2007... where he rehabilitated the city's image following a high-level corruption scandal. Xi developed a reputation here as a prudent leader who toed the party line. Just 7 months later, he finally returned to Beijing... having been promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee. Basically, the people who were deciding on top leadership at the time they wanted a Princeling. But they didn't want a princeling who was too ambitious or too strong. So Xi Jinping he was seen as less ambitious because he was willing to go to the countryside and work in lower-level positions. When Xi emerged as the 2007 National Congress and leadership unveiling... he was one of the 9 most powerful men in the country. It was at this moment that his strategic climb... over 17 long years in the countryside paid off. Big time. When the General Secretary stepped down in 2012... Xi emerged at the top spot in the party as China's leader. Now the elite son of a former revolutionary turned exiled peasant... turned party darling... was poised to seize control of everything. Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes that rallying around a single figure is crucial to the party's survival. Rather than the collective leadership Deng’s reforms had normalized. So pretty much as soon as Xi Jinping came to power. He started getting rid of people. “The news... four top officials removed for taking bribes was announced on state TV.” “Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.” “Just sacked his defense minister.” “He sacked a whole lot of other people at the top of the military establishment.” “The former security czar has not been seen in public for more than a year.” “The nvestigation against Zhou allows the Chinese president to remove those opposed to his reforms.” He launched a major anti-corruption campaign... as soon as he took power in late 2012, early ‘13... which led to the arrests of hundreds of senior-level officials as well as military officers. These purges targeted Xi's rivals in the party... whose vacant positions he filled with his own supporters. After this massive purge... Xi Jinping was in very tight control over both the party and also the Chinese military... thereby making him the most powerful leader of the Chinese Communist Party since the death of Mao. That pattern continued in the second term where he unveiled 5 new faces of the Politburo Standing Committee... three of them with close personal ties to Xi. In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his most dramatic acts yet... to enforce his influence over the Chinese Communist Party. He introduced a third historic resolution that unified the party's ideology around one clear line of thinking: Xi Jinping Thought. Xi's personal political ideology... would now be the core in the party's thinking... political stance and action. Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas could no longer be challenged. And they weren't for many years. During Xi's first 10 years in power the size of China's economy more than doubled. So did average individual income. So did military spending. Under his leadership... China's presence on the world stage has grown too. Positioning the rising superpower to take on the role of an aggressor, externally. Reasserting claims over parts of the South China Sea Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet and stripping democratic process in Hong Kong. Inside its own borders strict Internet censorship and surveillance are widespread... and oppression of Uyghurs... a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group... is marked by human rights abuses. But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw the first real challenge to his authority. “Anger in China is growing.” “Video showing protester is in Xinjiang... fed up with China's zero Covid rules.” “The boldest public challenge yet for leader Xi Jinping.” With these protests all around the country... and the party's reputation in peril. Xi reversed the failed policy. But is now faced with a shaky economy... and cracks in his unchecked authority. It was just weeks before the widespread protests at the 20th National Congress in 2022... that Xi walked out in the leading position a third time. He had already locked in the presidency for another five years... and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee completely packed with those loyal to him. After removing the final senior members of the party that had ties to his predecessor. Now there is no one left in party or military leadership whose ideology differs from Xi. I don't think anyone can push him out at this point. I think Xi will be the most powerful leader in China... as long as he's alive and conscious. Thanks so much for watching this episode of Atlas.
