"Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/, EYEN-styne; German:  ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year). These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. A joint paper in 1935, with physicist Nathan Rosen, introduced the notion of a wormhole. Alongside physicist Leo Szilard, he invented a refrigerator that consisted of no moving parts and used only heat as an input. In the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose-Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that God does not play dice. Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics. In 1999, he was named Time's Person of the Century.","Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity .

"And my congressional source tonight is Democratic Senator of Connecticut Chris Murphy. And it's great to have you here, Senator, this pause that the judge has put in place on on what the Trump administration has done here is also only temporary. It goes until Monday. The white House was arguing to me today that this is, quote, within the president's power to do it, and therefore he is doing it. Do you believe that the action the Trump administration is taking here is illegal is grossly unconstitutional? it is absolutely clear, based upon prior Supreme Court decisions, but the president cannot unilaterally suspend government programs in order to impose his own priorities and his own policy on top of what was passed by Congress. To me, this is inherently corrupt. What Trump is trying to do is seize control of government spending so that he can send money to his friends and to his loyalists, and he can punish states, for instance, like Connecticut, that are represented by his political opponents. Obviously, today was a day of chaos. The Medicaid program was down, had start reimbursements were down. By the end of the day, they came back up. but what he is trying to do is send a message that if you don't line up with me and my political priorities, it's going to cost you and your state money. How is it affecting people in Connecticut? Because that was kind of how we were hearing that the portals for Medicaid were down, and that they expected them to come back up. But what what did you hear from constituents today about this? Well, what we heard today was that hospitals and doctors weren't getting paid. our headstart programs are preschool programs in Connecticut today started to make plans to lay off employees and consider shuttering their doors to kids because they run in a way where they can't go more than a few days or a week without payment. Our school systems that rely on federal dollars to pay for special education are, as we speak, making plans to potentially downsize, the services that they offer kids in need because they're not sure that those payments will be available to them for the rest of the school year. So the entire state is in crisis right now because so many of our young people are vulnerable. Populations rely on this consistent federal funding. And all we know is that from here until Monday, they will continue to receive that money and then all bets are off. So when the white House argues, as they did today, that individuals who get assistance won't be directly affected. You say I mean, that's not what happened today. I mean, today, Medicaid, which is a payment program that is due to individuals who qualified, was suspended. and there's absolutely no guarantee that individuals who are receiving veterans benefits or housing benefits are going to continue to receive those after Monday. Yeah. And of course, they say Medicaid is not affected. They were they are aware at the white House that the portals were down, which obviously speaks to to the confusion that was caused by this coming out last night. Some of your Republican colleagues were asked about this, what you just got out there, which is that this is Congress's power of the purse here in allocating this funding. This is what some Republicans had to say about this. I think it's appropriate to take a look at it and make sure there isn't. some of the various various think that some of the areas that could be restricted if they are, items of the executive branch has the authority to issue or to look at. He's not holding, he's reviewing it. And in the meantime, he's going to release it again. that's what he ran on. Why do you think the Republicans on Capitol Hill were not bothered or near as bothered as you are by by a very clear willingness by the white House to to subvert Congress when it comes to funding. I think for two reasons. One, they're pretty confident that if Trump is in charge of what states get money or what disasters get money, that their constituents in their states will be taken care of. Two this is also an exercise in withholding all of these payments so that the president can reserve money to pay for his giant tax cut, mostly going to billionaires and corporations. Think that's what he's doing here? I think that's part of the rationale here, is trying to create a pretext in which he can say, hey, don't worry about how much I'm giving away in a corporate tax cut or an elimination of the estate tax on the wealthiest billionaire families, because I saved a bunch of money by shutting down, funding for elementary schools and middle schools in this country. So for Republicans, their money probably still, you know, comes to their states and they get to, a little bit better argument that they have the money to pay for the billionaire and corporate tax cuts. I think all states right now are affected by this and the confusion of what this actually gets to. But the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said that he doesn't think it's unusual for an administration to pause funding and take a hard look and scrub how these programs are being spent and how they interact with the executive orders Trump signed. Is that how you see it, or do you believe this is a highly unusual. Well, it's not what I believe. It's just true. Never before in the history of the country has a president suspended all at once, virtually every federal program and every foreign aid program, and also sent out an order to agencies that if you see or suspect anyone inside your agency that isn't complying, you are to report them inside USAID. Yesterday, as you know, almost the entire senior leadership was dismissed, in an attempt to rid the agency of anybody that didn't share the very particular political priorities of the president. All of this is completely unprecedented. Stephen Miller is the deputy chief of staff to the deputy advisor to Trump, the Homeland Security advisor, when it comes to to policy on the former of there he was on with Jake Tapper earlier and he actually talked about these USAID employees. This is what he had to say. There's 2 million employees in the federal government. Overwhelmingly, the career federal service in this country is far left, left wing. The American people, I don't know that to be a fact. Well, I'll give you a great example. We looked at USAID as an example. That's 98%, 98% of the workforce, either, donated to Kamala Harris or their left wing candidate. What is your reaction to a senior West Wing employee seeming to say that they are looking into the political affiliations of career government employees? First of all, that's not true. 98% of employees at USAID did not donate to Kamala Harris. They are making, you said, or a left wing candidate was. They are they're they're making up facts. yes. They have made no bones about it. They want to purge from government people who just show up every day to implement the law and the Constitution. The only qualification to Donald Trump for you to serve in government is if you pledge a loyalty oath to him personally and are willing to facilitate his corruption. He is trying to turn government into an enrichment vehicle for his billionaire friends. He wants to steal from ordinary people in order to help his Mar a Lago crowd. And if you aren't interested in that agenda, then you can't work for the president of the United States. All those people, USAID, they are not partizans. They are not political. They are just trying to implement a system of assistance around the world that protects U.S. interests. Some people may ask, okay, everything you just laid out there, what are Democrats doing about it? House Democrats are having an emergency meeting tomorrow on Trump's federal funding freeze. But, I mean, it happened last night. We had today with all the confusion. Do you think that your party is responding to to Trump in a way that is that works in your view? Well, I think today has been a wake up call. what we did in the Senate today was denied the Republicans the ability to proceed to any legislation that doesn't have to do with restoring this funding and ending this corruption. I hope that my colleagues will view nominees to a different lens right now. We have Lee Zeldin up for the EPA tomorrow. Whatever you think about Lee Zeldin, he's going to the EPA to implement a deeply corrupt and unconstitutional policy. So I hope the Democrats will take a harder line on legislation and on nominees, because our entreaties to the country are arguments that this is a five alarm fire, are not going to be taken as serious unless we are using all the powers that we have available to us to stop the implementation of this corrupt agenda inside the new administration. And of course, Zeldin would argue that point that you made about what he's going to do at the EPA. there is a question of of these nominees. Some Democrats are trying to stall the vote for Russ. Vote who is Trump's pick to run the Office of Management and Budget, which handles all of this when it comes to the trillions of dollars in federal funding. He worked primarily on project 2025. He was questioned about it a lot in his briefing. This pause today, and this idea that they can eliminate parts of federal funding that Trump does not believe fits with his agenda, does align with what you read of some in project 2025. What do you make of that? You know, Trump said during the campaign, I don't know anything about project 2025. Those people aren't going to have anything to do with my administration. The people who are writing these executive orders are the people that constructed project 2025. And what project 2025 is, is an evisceration of democracy, so that the only people that serve in government are people that believe in deeply conservative ideas and believe in, preserving Donald Trump's political power. So yes, you are seeing project 2025 being put into effect right now. And Russ vote was, you know, one of the the prime authors and pushers of that agenda. Yeah. He seems very likely to get confirmed. Senator Chris Murphy, thank you for your time tonight.","julian zelizer: it's a wake-up call for the white house to pause funding . he says the president is trying to seize control of government spending so that he can send money to his friends and to his loyalists .

I'm Frank Proto a professional chef and coloring instructor and today I'm going to show you how to make a perfectly juicy chicken breast Frank style we're talking succulent delicious chicken breast not that dry stringy stuff that your grandma serves this is chicken breast 101 chicken breast doesn't need to be dry and stringy with a little bit of knowledge a little bit of technique it can be Juicy and Delicious every single time in front of me I have two different chicken breasts one is a little smaller one is a little larger I try and go for the smaller ones I feel like they're more tender they have a better texture this chicken breast I'm going to leave alone this chicken breast needs a little work before we can put it in the pan I'm going to take this chicken breast and I'm just going to get my chef knife put a flat hand on top and kind of cut it right down the center you'll notice that when I put my hand on top my thumb is kind of pointed up my fingers are pointed up I'm just putting light pressure down that light pressure will make it easier to cut and now we basically have two chicken breast from the one I feel like this is a better size to cook if it's too thick it takes a little longer you get dry ends and the center is usually a little pink so this way it's going to cook much more evenly some people will tell you pound this out with a meat mallet I don't really like to do that because I want my chicken breast to be nice and brown and if I pound it out and then sauté it it's going to be way overcooked by the time it's ready to eat when it comes to seasoning chicken breasts I'm a minimalist salt and pepper only spice rubs tend to burn when you sauté them when you're sautéing a chicken breast you want to make sure that before you put it in the pan you get a paper towel and Pat it dry that extra moisture will stop our chicken from browning so get all that excess moisture off before you put it in the pan when I season I use kosher salt and fresh crack black pepper whenever you season you want to start really high if I was to season like this you get little spots of salt if you season High you get a nice even distribution of salt pepper go a little bit on a fine grind with this and then we can turn it over and season the other side you want to season both sides chicken seasoned ready to go let's cook I have a stainless steel sauté pan in front of me I like these because they're a bit of a thicker gauge they're heavy bottom stainless steel sauté pan if you have a thin sauté pan what happens is you get burnt spots and undercooked spots I like to use cast iron for a lot of things like this but when I'm doing a pan sace I don't like cast iron because believe it or not it gets a little of that flavor from the pan that's why I use stainless steel there is no flavor transfer from the pan to the sauce when sautéing you want high temperature for a shorter amount of time you see I put salt on this chicken breast salt draws out moisture so before we go in the pan again you want to dab this to make sure they're not wet this way we ensure proper Browning my Pan's getting hot I like to use a neutral high smoke point Oil we're just using a vegetable oil here I don't use fancy oils for this because once they go in the pan all the flavor disappears and you can see right away it looks like waves it looks kind of shimmery and that's what I want if there's a little bit of smoke that's a good thing I'm going to dab off my chicken breasts and then when I drop them in the pan I'm dropping away from myself if I drop it towards myself I'm getting splashed with oil if I drop it away from myself I am not getting splashed with oil to lower my heat down a little don't be afraid to adjust your heat if you have to right now now I feel like I have the right amount of heat I took a quick peek underneath to see that I was Browning my chicken wasn't sticking but for the most part at this point you want to just leave it alone let the sauté pan do its work don't mess around don't move it around too much you can check occasionally to see how you're doing right we're getting some nice Browning in there don't mess around with it too much leave it alone I have a little bit of a dry spot here cuz the pan is a little boded in the middle so the oil kind of went to the edges so you'll notice that I always want my chicken breast to be sitting in the oil what this does is I don't have high spots and low spots my chicken Cooks nice and even on the surface what I'm looking for here is that we have a nice golden brown on that side look at that that's beautiful and then what I'm doing is I'm poking my chicken breast I know that it's raw but as I poke onto it it's super soft and as it Cooks to the right temperature it's going to go from super soft and kind of spongy to being really bouncy and that's what I'm looking for the texture of it right I don't want it to be soft and spongy I want it to kind of bounce back really nice you'll notice that I only have two breasts in here I have a third but I think that if I put too many in the pan it's going to overcrowd the pan what happens basically is it starts to steam steam is moisture and then your chicken breast does not get brown so don't overcrowd your pan I feel like this chicken breast is ready to go if you touch it it's got some nice bounciness to it I'm going to take it out and put it onto my resting rack this piece is a little thicker it needs a little more time you notice that I use my fingers cuz I have Chef hands you can always just push down with tongs to see how your bounciness is most people say that chicken breast needs to be cooked to about 165 in order for it to be fully cooked I find if chicken breast gets cooked to 165 it's dry I tend to go about 150 155 because they will continue to cook when you put them over here it's called carryover cooking if you're really unsure about when to take it off off you can always use a thermometer I kind of go by touch and feel even if it's a little pink or a little underdone we can always reheat it before we put the sauce on right now I'm getting some nice good spring back I'm going to take this out and let it rest I put my chicken on the resting rack so the meat can kind of equalize the juices can redistribute and we'll have a nice juicy chicken breast so you can see my chicken breast is nice and brown it's got some nice caramelization and that equals flavor I have some of my juices running off I can always reclaim those if I want part of the reason why chicken breast is so easy to mess up is because it's a super lean cut of meat there's little to no fat on it unless you keep the skin it's going to be a dry piece of meat so cooking it properly is where it's at for our chicken breast today we're going to do a super simple pan sauce that anyone can make you don't need to be a culinary genius to get this right if you're sautéing chicken breast a pan sauce is your friend in restaurants pan sauces don't really get made because they take a lot of time but this is a great technique for the home cook the star of the show here is that font and that is really necessary for a good pan sauce a fond is all the caramelized juices in the bottom of the pan it's super flavorful it's going to give color to your sauce uh and it's just going to make it taste great so my pan is getting hot I'm going to put just a little bit of fresh oil not a lot so I have about a couple of shallots here DIC nice and fine so you'll notice that I cook my shallots a little before I add my garlic I have a couple of cloves ofar garlic there Pan's a little dry so I'm just going to add a little more oil cuz I want these to sizzle and get nice and caramelized and brown so now my garlic and shallots are nice and brown I'm going to add chicken stock it stops the cooking of my shallots and garlic and that's going to be the main flavor base we're going to reduce this down reduction is a really great way to get flavor chicken stock by itself isn't super flavorful but if you reduce it you get a really nice chicken flavor it's probably going to take about 7 to8 minutes to reduce you got to got to be patient here take your time I turn my heat up a little cuz I want this to come to a simmer really quickly any chicken juices that you have should be put in there not oil but the juice that juice comes out of the chicken while it rests that should be put in your sauce do not waste that so we're going to let this come to a simmer you'll see that it's starting to come to a boil if you look at my bubbles here my bubbles are really small and fine as you reduce things like chicken stock you'll notice that it starts to get a little thicker and the bubbles get a little a little bit bigger and that'll tell you your sauce is getting to the right consistency just watch the Bubbles at this point I'm going to add just a pinch of salt I'm not going to go crazy with the salt because we're reducing this if you season this all the way right now and then you reduce it it's going to be way too salty little salt a little pepper and then we'll readjust later on when the sauce is close to being done the sauce is reduced by half I add my butter and that's that's what I want I want the butter to incorporate into the sauce at this point I'm making sure that I got everything off the bottom of the pan and I'm just going to mix it up so you can actually see my bubbles on the side getting bigger my sauce is getting thicker the butter emulsifies into the sauce and makes it creamy and delicious the classic French term for this is Monte o bur or to mount with butter I'm going to adjust and lower my heat and let this go a little slower so you can see my sauce is starting to get thick but what I'm looking for is that nape consistency and if I put my spoon in there and I run my finger through you can still see that it's a little liquidy it's not really sticking to my spoon but I want this this to kind of stick to my spoon and get a little thick right so you can see we have considerably less liquid than we did earlier what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn my heat on super low uh I'm going to hit it with some lemon juice one thing that I like to do is take the cut side and put it on my hand and when I squeeze I squeeze towards my hand so that the seeds get trapped in between my hand and the lemon half I like to add the lemon juice at the end because I want it to be fresh and bright I don't want really cooked lemon juice flavors just a little more seasoning salt and pepper I'm going swirl that around so the sauce is ready and this is what I'm looking for there's a lot less liquid in this pan right the sauce looks creamy it's thick I coat the back of my spoon I run my finger through there's a very sharp line and you can see on either side the sauce is stuck to my spoon and what you can do now is add some parsley parsley has a really nice bright fresh flavor to it I like to add it right at the end most people add just for color I love the flavor but look at that see how much sauce we have it's not a lot but it's nice and thick it's got a nice creamy consistency and that's our Pan sace the pan sace is done the chicken is rested it is time to Plate now I like to slice my chicken breast just to give it a little more visual peel so we can see the inside of it one thing that I always focus on here is this end piece no matter what I do this end piece is going to be a little dry so what I like to do is cut that Chef's neack now with our chicken breast I want to slice on a nice long angle you can see inside it's not dry it's still got some bounce to it it's Juicy and Delicious not overcooked I like to put the pan sauce on the bottom of the plate because if you take that pan sauce and put it on top you're kind of hiding that nice Browning that you did not only that it's kind of crispy and you're going to take away that crispiness that's a chicken breast I want to eat time to taste let's get in there you can see that it's nice and soft and tense tender it is not dry and stringy whenever I eat a chicken breast like this the sauce is key mop up the sauce as much as you can by the end of this your plate should be totally clean chicken breast can be delicious it's just takes a little technique a little bit of knowhow and patience it can be juicy I promise you,I have a stainless steel sauté pan in front of me I feel like this is a better size to cook if it's too thick it takes a little longer you get dry ends . when I drop them in the pan I'm dropping away from myself if I drop it towards myself I am getting splashed with oil to lower my heat down . I want this to come to a simmer really quickly any chicken juices that you have should be put in there not oil but the juices can redistribut,3,v1
"this is a narco submarine A stealth marine vehicle designed to transport drugs from South America to the US and sometimes even Europe over the last decade authorities have caught over 200 of these but there are many more out there today we will take a look at four different models ranging from simple all the way to transatlantic high-tech how do these submarines work how do they avoid detection and what does the Coast Guard do to catch  them there are many ways to smuggle cocaine into the high-profit markets of the US and Europe each year authorities seiz several hundred tons of cocaine before it reaches the streets and many more tons get past them in this game of cat and mouse cartel's constant come up with new ways to deliver their product at first Naros Subs were made for short trips but over time their production was professionalized a hidden industry began to flourish this is Oscar Moreno Ricardo Colombian authorities named him the king of semi submersibles here deep in the dense Colombian jungle hidden along a river he operates a clandestine Shipyard far beyond the reach of authorities in places like this one Ricardo and his competitors built submarines they can travel thousands of miles across the ocean carrying tons of cocaine these Narco submarines are designed to remain hidden but there are rare moments when we get a glimpse into their world hi Sutton studies the craft of Ricardo and the others he has dedicated his career to uncovering their secrets he's a specialist in defense analysis and unconventional Naval Warfare I've been looking at Narco submarines for about 15 years and keeping a database of all the incidents of Narco submarines and analyzing their designs and the trends that are evolving in that space now let's dive into our first sub this is a very typical Narco submarine they started to appear like this in the late 2000s and they're still being found today it's roughly 14 m in length and not a true submarine rather it's a so-called lowprofile vessel the top remains visible above the water line its color Blends in with the sea due to its low height radar systems have a hard time detecting it currently it is on route to Central America inside the cramped vessel five men sit in 10 silence every so often the low hum of the diesel engine pulses through the hull as it pushes them forward at 16 kmph the sub is divided into three compartments this middle is the crew area it's sparse and uncomfortable bunks cremm tightly together a single hatch above for entry here at the rear the diesel engine Roars vibrating against the thin fiberglass walls it is located behind the crew compartment so they can access it to do repairs up front the cargo hold is tightly packed with backs of cocaine 7.7 tons to be precise the crew uses the weight of the drugs Fuel and engine to keep the vessel low in the water the cargo on board will earn the cartel a hefty sum if the sub reaches its destination a Marine Patrol aircraft spots the Narco submarine and immediately alerts the US Coast Guard right now they are operating an international Waters two small boats and a helicopter raced to intercept the vessel once within range Coast Guard officers jump onto the ship and give the door a friendly knock they captured the five Smugglers along with the cocaine valued at well over $200 million if law enforcement had not acted so decisively the Smugglers could have opened the scuttling valve a last resort mechanism that floods the this up and sends it plunging to the ocean floor along with all its evidence This Crew had a relatively short Journey others travel half across the  world while Naros Subs are obviously used for organized crime their engineering and the Ingenuity behind their design are undeniably

start developing new skills  today a different part of the Amazon a NCO vessel departs near manau in Brazil and is making its way to makaa the Amazon's mouth this semi up was over 20 M long and nicknamed CH inside CH said three men August te Alvarez a former Spanish boxer and captain of The Vessel and two Ecuadorian men they are about to cross the Atlantic traveling at around 19 kmph they will cover roughly 6 and 1 12,000 km from the Brazilian Rainforest all the way to Europe with no GPS and only a compass to guide their way it will take them about 2 weeks to reach their destination if all goes according to plan this knos up is very similar to our first one but it is more modern and larger it also has three compartments you've got the engine in the back the crew in the middle and the cargo Bank nearly half the sub size is reserved for fuel three massive tanks holding 20,000 L ensuring The Vessel can make the long journey the men have no proper beds and use plastic bags as toilets for food they have the choice between energy bars rice or cans of sardines there's only one proper seat so two men must lie down at all times the men endured three storms and almost hit a larger ship on the way but finally managed to cross the Atlantic but well luck is not on their side after 27 days the sub runs out of fuel the journey took twice as long as planned because of the conditions at Sea they can't deliver the drugs to another vessel two attempts to meet with cartel boats fail as a last resort Alvarez contacts old friend from his hometown vgo and hopes to get help from them to unload the cocaine but this also fails so they travel near the coast of Galicia and sink The Vessel afterwards the crew wants to flee but law enforcement has already spotted them the eu's maritime analysis and operation Center has notified Spain that a suspicious vessel is heading for their Coast they watched them using night vision goggles and observed their arrival in Galicia officials arrested two Ecuadorian men shortly after the sinking Alvarez can flee he hides nearby in an abandoned house for 5 days and then finally gets arrested Spanish police refloat and confiscate the sunken submarine they find three tons of cocaine worth around $100 million every time one of these gets caught a cartel loses a lot of money reason enough to innovate at first glance this just looks like a real submarine it has the typical cylindrical shape and is around 24 M long this build can almost fully submerge only a snorkel protrudes from its top allowing the vessel to breathe drawing in air to cool its diesel engine and provide fresh oxygen for the crew it also gives the vessel its name the snorkel sub unlike most real submarines or or most Naval sub Marines is not built out of steel or metal it's built out of fiberglass a diesel engine Powers this up while an onboard generator provides electricity for various systems including a camera mounted at top the snorkel so they always have an idea of what's around them when they're underwater Bast tanks allow it to take in water and dive deeper when danger is spotted the interior feels crammed yet sophisticated there's a basic toilet and a sink small luxuries that make long Journeys more bearable for the crew the snorkel sub can haul up to 8 tons of cocaine carrying its eled cargo thousands of kilometers from Colombia to destinations like Mexico or Beyond so far not a single one of these has ever been caught at sea but we know they keep building them because the ones that we have got like this have always been captured on land so we can infer from that that they must be very successful and that makes sense Patrol aircraft will have a much harder time spotting this up through its camera system it can maneuver around and evade Coast Guard ships with much greater finesse the fact that such a complex machine gets built in a jungle in the middle of nowhere is remarkable these shipyards are far from traditional Supply chains or modern facilities Narco submarines are designed and the construction is overseen by Master Builders these are Artisans very technically proficient they're impressive designs in the sense that while they might look very shoddy and Mill they really are the perfect example of the minimum viable product these Subs need to be good enough to reliably transport extremely expensive cargo thousands of miles but at the same time they have to be built with very basic materials not many people are capable of doing that these Master Builders there's only so many of them and we can tell that because each designer if you like has signature they they have certain ways of solving problems that reveal themselves in the designs and one of these Builders far outshines the rest in November 2020 law enforcement stumbled upon something extraordinary in the Colombian jungle a fully submersible 12 M long Narco submarine there's no fuel storage and no diesel engine in the back instead the subh hous is a whopping 10 tons of batteries powering two electric motors this is the peak of Nao sub Ingenuity construction costs roughly $1.5 million dive planes control the depth of the submarine its batteries have an estimated endurance of 12 hours traveling at 5 kmph this sub could reach a travel distance of about 60 km this sub can travel neither fast nor far but it doesn't have to this vessel is not designed to make long Journeys on its own do you see this little thing here that's a towering ring it can be attached to larger ships allowing the Narco sub to be pulled long distances undetected when the Smugglers reach their destination or Coast Guard appears they simply unhook and continue on their own this up is extremely hard to detect in fact it has never been found in action authorities have only discovered this one example in the Colombian jungle but there are most likely many more of them out in the waters we can infer that it's incredibly successful just like the other all Narco submarines are statistically successful most get through but these ones are even harder to find and has never never been seen in the wild this Naros is proof that drug smugglers continue to design new sophistic ated vessels to move drugs into profitable markets the trend has been towards smaller payad they carry less drugs than they used to but there's more of them and so it's really about optimizing their supply lines and getting the the drugs to the market minimizing the risks when the sub completes its Mission it may end up here in a massive graveyard of Nako subm Marines on the ocean floor because almost all of them are only Built for a one-off trip in 2022 the reign of Oscar Moreno Ricardo the so-called king of Narco submarines came to an end after years of eluding authorities he was finally arrested in a joint operation by Colombian and American authorities his capture marks a significant victory for law enforcement but it is far from a decisive blow another worthy successor will most likely have already taken his place somewhere in the depths of the Colombian jungle a new genius is already working on the next generation of Narco submarines more advanced more sophisticated and designed to beat the latest tactics of law enforcement",Naros Subs are designed to transport drugs from South America to the US and sometimes even Europe over the last decade . they are a very typical Narco submarine they started to appear like this in the late 2000s and they're still being found today it's roughly 14 m in length and not a true submarine . the sub is divided into three compartments this middle is the crew area it is sparse and uncomfortable bunks cremm tightly together a single hatch above for entry here .,4,v1
"this is the tyang go on board is Kim Jong-un the ruler of North Korea he almost never leaves his country but when he does he travels on rail in the so-called moving Fortress right now he just left pongyang his destination is the v kodom in Russia to meet Vladimir Putin the journey will take him around 2 days and well over 1,000 km through for on land Kim has many enemies how does the tyang go keep him safe Fern only a few North Koreans have access to the regular internet if you're able to watch this video you're probably living in a country that allows you to access all the websites and

them out you support our reporting the tyang go is escorted by two additional trains one drives ahead to check for dangers like planted explosives on the tracks or ambushes on the sides the other one secures the back it is filled with heavily armed secur security ready to rush to the Supreme Leader's rescue if need be a helicopter Scouts the area ahead he accompanies the Convoy the entire time Kim is traveling through North Korean territory cargo planes station additional Personnel at the closest airports along the Route the tyang go has reinforced bulletproof windows its walls and bottom are hardened to withstand explosions multiple compartments are carrying heavy Weaponry the train is equipped to fight back against attacks from above with anti-aircraft missiles it also carries anti-tank missiles and two machine guns to aggressively fend off attacks from either side of the tracks if all defenses fail the train carries a helicopter so Kim can flee from the scene all this makes Kim's train extremely safe but also extremely heavy the tyan go travel Trav at only 60 kmph sometimes even slower due to the poor condition of Railways in North Korea when the train passes by a station the power is cut off on all other tracks there are 20 Railway stations in the country that were built solely for this one train because of the slow speeds Kim might be on the road for several days on end just like during this particular trip to meet Putin on board he has everything he needs to govern his Country Day and Night an office with a desk laptop television fax machine satellite phone and a map of China in the Korean Peninsula on the wall a reception room a meeting room with a table the interior style is quite eclectic most rooms are entirely white with shiny wooden floors there are green and hot pink sofas Ivory and turqu oise curtains flower-shaped lamps and zebra patterned fabric seats but the highlight of the train is the restaurant on board you can find all sorts of Delicacies from Korean Russian Chinese Japanese and French cuisine Kim Jong-un won't get bored during the journey either the train has singers on board who serenade the supreme leader personally when stepping off the train two onard Bo armored Mercedes limousines are unloaded for the last mile train travel has a long tradition in the Kim family this is the kumu Xin Palace where the remains of kimil sun and Kim Jong Il are laid to rest right next to their remains you'll find life-size models of their personal train carriages there's even said to be a painting of Kim Jong Il proudly standing next to his train a map with small lights shows the many Journeys they took taking the train started as a safety precaution Kim Jang ill was reportedly also just a bit afraid of flying in 2001 he took a train journey lasting almost a month all the way to Moscow covering a total of 20,000 km a Russian official named Constantine pakowski accompanied him after the journey he published a book about his experiences much to the irritation of both the Russian and North Korean governments that's because for a long time the Korean leaders trains were shrouded in utter mystery it was never announced when they would move and where also the interior was largely kept secret in 2004 Kim Jong 's train passed the Yung Chung station near the border with China just hours later a massive explosion killed about 160 people and injured 1,300 more supposedly a train parked at the station Laden with oils and chemicals was hitting power lines there were speculations that this might have been an assassination attempt that's not entirely unlikely there have been many reports of internal power struggles in North Korea over the decades the security of the train was reportedly boosted after the incident in 2009 Russian photographers were banned from taking pictures of the train while it was on route to the then president Dimitri Medvedev entire villages in Siberia were instructed to stay indoors until the train had passed in the era of smartphones this is no longer possible and in some cases not really desired because the train also serves propaganda  purposes the taang go fittingly means Sun it has become a powerful symbol for North Korea Kim Jong-un is said to use it to appear down toe and close to the people in Star contrast to the lofty image of the US president his giant jumbo jet and political leaders traveling by train is one way or another a symbol after the invasion of Ukraine the airspace above the country became unsafe many Western leaders started to visit Kiev by train through Poland this has been coined as iron diplomacy in the case of North Korea the tyang go in some ways accentuates just how uniquely isolated the country is the Supreme leaders rarely or perhaps never visit most parts of the world there's also a certain irony in the train supposedly symbolizing the modesty of the Kim family Journeys always have a destination Kim's train finally arrives at fi cosmodome he is greeted with one of the longest and perhaps most uncomfortable handshakes in history then Putin gives him the full tour a space port an aircraft Factory and the Pacific Fleet later there's vodka a ballet performance and a walrus show the reason the two men meet is quite serious however Russia is running low on ammunition and allies and its war against Ukraine North Korea has enormous stocks of ammo and is not afraid to supply it in return the country could receive technical support from Russia for building new satellites and missiles for its nuclear weapons program no official outcome has been announced but Russian foreign minister Sergey lavro recently visited pangang shortly after the meeting he thanked North Korea for its support in the Ukraine conflict and reaffirm the partnership between both countries North Korea in turn officially recognize the territories captured by Russia as Russian Sovereign territory lavro didn't commit on weapons deliveries but according to the US government North Korea has already delivered over 1,000 containers of ammunition and military equipment to Russia North Korea and Russia both have very few International allies left while the tyang go tries to be a symbol of power for North Korea it is also a sign of the country's deep isolation Vladimir Putin has accepted an offer to visit Kim Jong-un and return this would be a good chance for him to take his very own ghost  train",the tyang go is escorted by two additional trains one drives ahead to check for dangers like planted explosives on the tracks . the other one secures the back it is filled with heavily armed secur security ready to rush to the Supreme Leader's rescue if need be a helicopter Scouts .

A PID identifies and locates an entity regardless of where it is hosted or published and enables its unambiguous and long-term identification. PIDs are an essential component of the research ecosystem, linking researchers and research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. In this blog post, we will explore the different types of PIDs, their applications, and how researchers can use PIDs to comply with the FAIR data principles and the funder requirements. Types of PIDs There are several types of PIDs commonly used in research, shown as follows. PIDs for People (Researchers): Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers (ORCID iDs) PIDs for Objects (Research Outputs): Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) PIDs for Places (Research Organizations): Research Organization Registry (ROR) IDs, and Crossref Funder Registry IDs ORCID iDs are assigned to researchers and support automatic links to their research outputs. ORCID iDs can be linked to a researcher’s affiliations, funding sources, and publications, making it easier to identify their contributions and track their research impact. DOIs are the most widely used PIDs assigned to research outputs such as journal articles, protocols, books, datasets, and software. DOIs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite digital objects, facilitating their discoverability, accessibility, and interoperability. RRIDs are unique identifiers assigned to research resources such as antibodies, cell lines, model organisms, and other tools (software, databases, services). RRIDs enable researchers to unambiguously identify and cite the research resources they use, facilitating reproducibility and reuse of research data. ROR IDs are unique identifiers assigned to research organizations, including universities, research institutes, and funding agencies. ROR IDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their affiliated organizations, making tracking research impact and identifying collaborations easier. Crossref Funder Registry IDs are unique identifiers assigned to funding agencies, allowing researchers to track the funding sources of their research outputs and demonstrate the impact of specific funding programs. Applications of PIDs to Comply with FAIR Data Principles PIDs are not only critical to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles but also to making data machine-readable or machine-actionable. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder IDs in research outputs, researchers can make data more easily discoverable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, and machine-actionable. Machine-actionable data means that data can be processed and understood by machines or software. PIDs enable researchers to link their research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata, making it easier to discover and access research data. PIDs also facilitate the reuse of research data or protocols by enabling researchers to easily cite and credit the sources of their data and protocols. PIDs also play a critical role in ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of research data. PIDs enable researchers to uniquely identify and cite their research resources, facilitating the replication of experiments and ensuring the accuracy of research data. By incorporating PIDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their data more interoperable, allowing machines to process data and metadata more efficiently. PIDs follow established standards and enable data to be shared and reused without the need for transformations, making data more interoperable with existing and future systems. This facilitates the integration of data from multiple sources and enables researchers to make new discoveries that would not be possible without PIDs. In conclusion, PIDs play a critical role in research by enabling the unique identification, citation, and linking of research outputs to their underlying data and associated metadata. By incorporating PIDs such as DOIs, ORCID iDs, RRIDs, ROR IDs, and Funder Registry IDs in their research outputs, researchers can make their research outputs more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR data principles) required by many funders and publishers and contribute to the open data ecosystem.
