      "some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier [Music] this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken [Music] with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first [Music] salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked [Music] make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there [Music] now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavour on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] so smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated piles and cheese give your veg some attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is new york cheesecake because it's baked it says no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate [Music] the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] you\n",

      "my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cereso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and get your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to the bowl i'm gonna infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chilli's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that make sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated it tastes really fishy you've got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really sumptuous rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day whether it's breads cakes tarts pies or pastries bacon is one of the most seductive skills in the kitchen it fills the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catching needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with the oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission star establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive getting to grips with bacon is just a matter of confidence slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouthwateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so\n",

the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to

you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there [Music] now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick

nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked

out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter

      "some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the

hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier [Music] this is a young tender broccoli

      "in every Michelin Star Kitchen there's a foundation every Chef is taught to master these techniques have influenced modern cuisine around the world more than any other developed by Augusto scoffier these sources aren't just recipes they're the basis for experimentation and Innovation these are the five mother sources every Chef needs to master this is the book that most people get when they go to college as a foundations for French cooking and it covers the five basic mother sources it basically means there's five different basic sources which you can use for different types of recipes and different types of variations scoffier was a notable Chef in France who used to cook for Royals very influential he didn't just come up with this book which is like over 7,000 recipes he also came up with the principles of the French kitchen it was mirrored on the French military system so Chef dep party all the way up to head chef so First Source bashal in his book this is one of the mother sources because there's so many different things you can do with a bashal get this milk warm he says to add an onion studded with cloves to add a different Aroma the key principle of a bashal is it starts with a r and it's a milk-based sauce so there's a point of difference between a bashal and other sauces normally the other sauces contain stock but this is basically just a r with a flavored milk so the bamal sauce Rumor Has It historically was uh created for Louis the 14th bringing up this butter to like a light nuttiness roughly speaking it's almost equal parts butter to flour Co and you can start to see where it turns starts to turn all golden and that's just the milk solids turning um turning that color so add your flour now and allow that to cook out turn the heat right down otherwise you'll burn it and then the consistency that I was always trained to look for is it's almost should look like wet sand I think it's a a nice way to saying it but it does kind of it does kind of make sense froy and foamy and also a little bit golden always add warm milk to a bashal and I think that's where a lot of people go wrong with bashal you'll notice that like we're not slicing the onion up so it's actually a very sort of delicate way to flavor up the milk it's not like loads of slices of onion so it's like tastes like stewed onion and then all of that lightly season the milk cuz it cooked if you're adding a cold liquid into that sauce what can happen is it'll coagulate way too much um and then it'll take time to bring it back up to the right temperature and then that sauce will get too thick so I've added all of the milk at the same time it wouldn't cook out nicely and you'd get these like massive lumps and what happens is when I'm doing it like this the friction of beating it together gets rid rid of those lumps and then you can keep adding little bits of milk until it's the right consistency if you wanted to just make a white sauce which we traditionally serve with Christmas pudding in the UK you remove the onions and you'd have add a little bit of nutmeg or if you wanted to make a a mouret sauce then once this is cooked out properly then you add in your cheese and that would be used to make a lasagna or something like that this probably been about 5 minutes and what you got this beautiful consistency quite thick and Rich and glossy but you can also see those lightly brown little bits of butter in there as well but what we're going to do is quickly turn this into a a sawu beast it's really simple I've sweated down some onions without any color so they always talk about with a bashal uh line in the back of a spoon and what does that exactly mean when I trace my finger through it the line that goes through is perfectly left inside the sauce so suis is just one of the variations of a bashal so just blending up the bashal with the onions the onions are basically all they're going to do to that is just add this really nice sweetness they're not going to break down fully because they're not properly caramelized so I'm just passing it for a fine shiv into a into the same pan that I used before okay so this is our subis so I just whack it into a pan small amount of um your subie sauce little bit of leak oil on there now just a nice bit of salmon nice and crispy very simple it's not going to overpower any sort of flavor uh you could add lots of different things to that fresh ches at the end maybe you could even add a splash of white wine into the base number one of mother sauces bashal right next source so we're going to do a volut now so a volut has actually got very similar principles to a bashal it starts with a room probably my favorite of the foundational sauces because it's the most versatile whereas Bal is using milk here you're using St you're not really reliant on the butter flavor like you are in a bashal you're more reliant on the flavor of your stock or whatever you're finishing your Volute with so same ratio you've got in the with the bashel it should still look a little bit like wet sand but just a little bit lighter in color than a bashal what I've got here is just white chicken stock two different types of stock white chicken stock or brown chicken stock white chicken stock just means that I've not roasted the bones a much more delicate flavor the term valute comes from the French velour which essentially means velvet and that's quite a large part of what this sauce is I mean it it it's if when done properly it's an incredibly smooth sauce and it can look really really elegant on a plate so all I'm doing is just adding stock bit by bit just like with the bashal what I want is I want something that lines the back of the spoon so it's got a nice body to it but at the same time it's not too claggy and it's got that stunning velvety texture you could easily turn this into a mustard Volute add a bit of mustard and serve it with a chicken breast okay so perfect we've got here is finished voluto super shiny and glossy on the back of the spoon still leaves a trace I've just added a little bit of salt I'm going to turn this into a herb green sauce return it bright green with a bit of spinach which I'll just blanch first to release the chlorophyll and a tablespoon of mustard easy peasy okay so to finish this valute really simply what I'm going to do some spinach to a pan and blanch it all you're doing is just look to release the chlorophyll we'll take that out some herb so I've got some parsley and I'm just going to pick some taragan as well so all onto the same board so a couple of chops and then that can all just go into blanch as well so there's a few more stalks inside the uh the herbs so just they'll just need to be cooked up slightly longer than you would the spinach and then these can go into the ice as well you could use this as the base for a really beautiful fish pie or just a nice fish dish and just squeeze all of the excess moisture out of there can be quite liberal with the herbs cuz it literally does go down to absolutely nothing perfect so that's all our taragan parsley spinach mix in there the Volute goes on top so mix is just a high power blender so got this beautiful bright green herb Volute just going to finish that with a little bit of mustard that's been blitzing for about 2 minutes to be honest the thermom mix is a really good bit of kit but I've had just a sort of similar uh similar outcomes with a neutri buet at home so once you've added the mustard in there that's going to be basically a form of acidity so typically what you do in restaurants is you'll make the base sauce which is the best the herb bashal and then you'll acidulate it to order so you'll add a little bit of uh vinegar just before you send it acid in the vinegar gets rid of all the greenness out of the sauce so best served with some sort of white protein cuz it's a nice green sauce I've just got a nice chicken breast here and then just start from the center chicken goes on you could serve that with wilted spinach or anything like that tiny little bit of truffle oil a proper solid dish but that is just sauce and protein super easy foundational sauce okay number three Espagnol actually didn't originate in Spain it's a French sauce basically it just means Spanish in French essentially this is just a meat-based sauce it could be very versatile first in the pan is bacon then you're going to add a miror p to that we've got some celery we're just going to really nicely and very finely chop up so miror is just terminology for celery onion carrot vegetable combination in France much as the Italians have safo so dicing up your vegetables we'll just do half a white onion as well so we got this beautiful foam in bacon at the moment diced onions goes in and then the moisture from the onions is going to almost Del glaze the pan the reason you're adding all of these different aromat and vegetables is just essentially for sugar so you want to cook them down and you can see that we had that bacon fat on the bottom of the pan and now that's all been rendered away so now what we're going to do is just add a tiny a little bit of color to these onions add in the rest of our vegetables and then we'll proceed to add in our thickener which is in this case a r Okay so we've added a little bit of color to those onions and most of the residual waterers sort of disappeared now so I'm just going to add in the rest of the vegetables so in terms of this sauce this is the base for a lot of other sauces say a bord la which has got like mushrooms a little bit of bow marrow in there and then something like a chicken shash chasser something like a a Dian sauce so it it can be the base of a demig glass as well so once all of those vegetables have softened just going to add in the butter but I'm not going to go crazy cuz I've got a nice a nice beef stock here to allow that to sweat off so once our Butters melted I added about 50 g I'm just going to add just under that in flour cook that out slightly okay so that's cooked out lightly and now I'm just going to add my beef stock so I've got a nice Rich beef stock that we use in the restaurant if you're doing this at home you could always just use some stock cubes release most of the sauce from the bottom of the pan just make sure there's absolutely nothing by way of fond left of the bottom just reduce the the heat right down now what you want to do is cook this for a long time in order to get rid of any sort of flour that's left in there but also so that the vegetables can release all of the sweetness as well so it's slightly different to to what we were doing with the other sources with a sauce like this it's really difficult because there's different levels of Sweetness in different types of vegetables and that can change depending on season and a sauce like an Espagnol will take a lot more adjusting than just uh the bashal or a valute when you hear about a Sauer being one of the most important positions in the kitchen I think that's because if you take shortcuts in a in a sauce say you over roast the vegetables or you don't take time to take the fond off the bottom of the pan or any of those little steps you can taste that in the final sauce SAU will always always be tasting their sauce all the way through not just at the end this has been simmering now for about 15 minutes and you can see what's happened the the sauce is reducing it's really nice and thick and it's almost got this really nice Sheen and and Clarity to it which is just the butter and those natural thickening collagen juices from the beef stock one of the best ways that I use to serve this is uh is like a classic duck alange the juice of of two nice in seas and oranges if you imagine I've got all my soft vegetables in here I don't want to get too many impurity in my sauce so just tapping it by the side obviously the yield of your sauce would be a little bit affected so just one big push don't take it too far you could wash that again bring it to the boil and then put that back into the sauce and that's called what that's what they call it a remage so typically when you're making sauces in restaurants you would you would uh boil all of your socks for the second boil and there what you'd get is your sunde gravy or something like that orange at the end it should be thin so that it lines your mouth and if it's too thick what happens is it's almost like act as a barrier so you're uh your taste buds can't properly taste it so it's delicious does need a touch of salt just need a touch of vinegar just for a little bit of freshness at the end consistency of the sauce is nice nice and shiny cook it on the crown the much more delicate way of cooking the duck hose carve duck is\n",

      "all right home cooks it's time for you to demonstrate another classic french technique are you primed to see what it is yes yes you look terrified just need to know what it is this time your survival depends on [Music] a butter basted steak perfectly cooked to medium rare the french term for this technique is arose we're looking for a beautifully browned crust a tender pink interior with just a hint of red this is what i'm looking for exactly you got it yes yes i make butter basic steak fairly often so i have a really good shot at making it up to the balcony after this round the first thing i do is get my pan searing hot one of the most important aspects of this dish is getting a beautiful sear on the steak i'm very happy that it's steak and not a french omelet again two minutes to bring the pan up to high heat eight minutes to cook and five minutes to let your steak relax and you'll be cooking a perfect medium rare i'm extremely focused just trying to get this done in a timely manner so i have more than enough time to rest my skin [Music] it's very important when you seize a meat to be liberal because a lot of that seasoning will be lost to the pan i have to amp this salt up and butter i do not want to let the judges down i'm secretly rooting for jonathan he's an amazing charismatic guy and has a good soul i really do want this but i'm also missing my family my mom taught me how to cook she was a single mother and raised my brother and i i want them to be proud of what i'm gonna put on the plate today all the seasoning's been wiped off of jonathan he's wiping all the seasoning off [Music] smells smart just waiting for my oil to smoke i wanted to rip my hair out oh come on when the steak goes in you want to hear it sizzle if you don't get that sizzle you are in trouble right out of the gate [Music] i love the intensity of the pressure test i can see the fear in their eyes and it's kind of exciting to see [Music] i know marissa is a badass mistake so i'm really happy to be up on the balcony because the difference between having a perfect stake and being underdone or overdone is really minute i've got adrenaline going through my veins this is it i want to be up there with my buds i i need to be up there i don't want to wait any longer i'm pretty confident in marissa because she's into proteins and the rest are a bit iffy [Music] you want the exterior of that steak to caramelize add more butter and baste and base to keep it moist everything they do matters here the way they season the way they sear the way they rest everything matters [Music] look at nadia's pan it is spewing off lots of big smoke there that concerns me she could be burning her herbs she could be burning the steak she could be burning the garlic one second can ruin my dish if i do not get the heat right in this pan i'm done five minutes five minutes left make sure you leave enough time to rest your steak the seer on the outside is perfection i just want to see a beautiful pink center [Music] i lay my stake down very carefully and i just wait patience is a virtue five four three two one and stop [Music] [Applause] i'm feeling very unsure like here's unsure and i'm like here i'm only gonna find out if i nailed it and the judges sliced that bad boy open [Music] jonathan what is the color that you're trying to achieve in the center of the steak the medium rare you miss some of the caramelization here you can see that see how it's gray yeah see that let's make the cut and see if you actually made the cut [Music] boom look at that that's perfect it's a thing of beauty thank you how's it taste could use more salt but overall really solid performance thank you i'm thrilled i feel a little bit more confident where's that chef michael you a steak lover i am a steak lover i actually heard you have a dog by the name of waterhouse porterhouse is my dog interesting are you pleased with the outcome using this classic french technique yes i am i achieved a nice sear on all sides of the steak so let's see how you did on the cook [Music] very good [Music] i think it could have been pushed just a little bit more with the seasoning you lose a lot of salt and pepper when you're cooking and basting but not bad at all just wish it was a porterhouse thank you marissa thank you chef nadia hello chef alvin pam with smoking you cook a lot of steak i have but

roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out\n",

      "beautiful off go the eyebrows welcome to Next Level kitchen where I'm challenging myself and my fellow judges to cook up delicious recipes full of tips amazing tricks to help take your cooking to the next level so today my challenge is to make an amazing cheap not too expensive steak night dinner perfect for a great date nights with a friends or even family but first let me run you through the ingredients Now Steak uh this is a beautiful skirt steak it's one of the sort of butcher Cuts it's very delicious um doesn't look the most appetizing but once it's cooked it is incredible the secret here is to let it rest and cut on the bias basically a cut across um arom mats some fresh rosem some th a little bit of garlic for the pepper sauce the peppercorn sauce is shalots and garlic and then these little mouse Piper potatoes basically potatoes full of lots of starch I'm going to show you a little trick how to get them super thin we're going to blanch them twice at a low heat and then whack up the temperature and get them nice and crispy they're going to be called shoestring fries first off the steak okay it's really important to help this steak marinade so again I like to get the steak marinated with seasonings 10 15 minutes before I cook it salt pepper and then just roll that in and literally get the steak up the room temperature if you get the steak up the room temperature I I promise you it will cook so much more even the fat will soften therefore it will render quickly if a steak comes out the fridge and it's ice cold it's really impossible to get that cook spot on especially in the center now from there Touch of oil get that pan nicely smoking I like to get the garlic and literally just crush the garlic with the back of the knife lightly and that will allow all that oil to really perfume steak in layer away from you now I've got a really nice sort of beveled Edge on that pan use the pan and let the pan do the work tilt the pan and it Cooks the back of the steak and really keep that on a high heat if we don't get the color on there the actual skirt steak turns really gray so be vigorous with the color and show some confidence but let the pan do the work turn down the heat and let if your pan starts getting too hot add a touch more cold oil to cool the thing down now the potatoes these have been washed cleaned and peeled and this little Gadget here cost literally £250 it's the amazing peeler but not just any peeler it's a peeler that literally Cuts nice little string across and just get onto the corner of the potato and literally pull down and you can see what's starting to happen look got these nice beautiful shw string fries and the secret here is blanching them don't need to wash the potato I don't like washing off all the star just open them up get the peeler on the corner and just go down and around now they're called Sho string cuz they literally do look like a shoe string okay and again the secret here is making sure that we blanch these first and then back in to the oil the second time it's amazing how far one potato can literally go now that I got a little groove on there go back over turn my steak and look now I've got that color in there turn the gas right down and stick in my Thyme and Rose meat with that a little bit of butter now and all we're going to be doing is adding some some really nice texture and flavor to that lovely steak gas right down and just roll that skirt steak around all those arom mats as the butter caramelizes it turns into rece nut brown flavor the herbs start to perfume the steak and once I've colored the steak nicely I like to sip the herbs underneath and I like to just literally rest that steak on top of those herbs and literally turn the gas right down and just leave that steak sat there now back to the potatoes again nice thin shards this is a great way of sort of making I call them quick fries now look open them up beautiful don't season them at this point but just make sure they're all nicely separated so 150° or 350 F lift your basket up and then literally drop them in now this is called blanching okay and the secret here is to get a really nice crispy texture on those fries so we're not actually cooking them we're sort of getting them half cooked going take them out and then whack up the temperature and get them really nice and crispy now have a look at that steak that is absolutely beautiful herbs doing its job I'm so happy with that I don't want it literally medium I like this thing medium rare okay so plenty butter in there now now for the peppercorn sauce this is a really easy sauce to make get your pepper corns whole pepper corns sprinkle them onto the board nice and gently I like this s course quite hot Bas of the pan and then just literally crunch also I don't like it too fine so that peppery flavor comes out now shalot onions just as good but I don't want it too finely chopped otherwise it burns I want to really start TI toasting the flavor of those amazing pepper corns chalot nicely slice garlic now blanching basically is cooking without any color as you can see these Sho string fries are sort of half cooked now I'm going take them out let them rest turn up the heat again continue rolling that steak and just let it sit there and amongst all all that wonderful Flavor now peppercorn sauce a little touch of oil open up the flavor of those pepper corns and toasting these pepper corns now we really bring out that nice peppery flavor I love it so just lightly toast them in with the shots this sauce is so easy to do so straightforward and so delicious now I've toasted the pepper couple of little knobs of butter in there okay and now with my garlic I don't want to slice the garlic I'm going to literally just grate that garlic over the shots that basically purees the garlic really nicely done and look under you there got that lovely garlic and add that into those shots now T more oil once those shalots start to [Music] caramelize you can see now with that garlic it almost disappears but it does its job and this is where the sauce goes up to another level okay pepper corns are infus us and if I had to taste those shalots now they're really peppery but we toasted them so it's a really nice mellow toasting and that's why I want the shalots nice and thick or the onions nice and thick because I don't want to lose the texture of that nice sweet caramelized beautiful onion Flavor now for the exciting part little bit of Brandy M stand back turn up the gas and Flay here we go beautiful off go the eyebrows they'll touch in there for good measure M look at that steak just sitting in that beautiful flavored oil beautiful so good I love letting that steak cool down in the pan because it's got the residual heat but more importantly it sort of protects it now once that Brandy has evaporated got this really nice sweet caramelized peppery flavor and now just a couple of tablespoons of beef stock and what we're looking for is almost like a caramel color reduce that beautiful stock down shalot of caramelized got that really nice peppery flavor as it's starting coming down to a glaze we going to add a heavy cream literally half the amount of cream as we did stock and that will give a really nice rich consistency so think about it steak's resting got this beautiful aav sauce and now for the fries just break them up again whack up your heat and then back in and this time it's going to go quick now you're going to see the color on these fries beautiful and they're starting to look like Sho right correct the seasoning of the sauce now whilst you're M that's delicious tou as salt doesn't need any more pepper reduce that down I want a nice thick Rich consistency now look at these fries beautiful take them out I love put them in a bowl with a little bit of paper in there okay that absorbs any excess fat they're really crispy in lightly season them I've got a little touch of smoked paprika as well and then on top of that a really nice grating of age parmesan and that makes the fries cheesy spicy and really delicious good let them sit there until we're ready now I like to keep this presentation simple okay the steak we never slice that too many times otherwise the goodness goes on on the board and not on the plate sauce is coming down first off get your fries and literally lift them up into a nice big nest set them on the plate you can hear how crisp they are and they look like these beautiful fried Sho string and then literally look at that steak now you've got those beautiful lines we're going to slice on the bias and just take it off there check it's nice and medium rare check the seasoning M beautiful one 2 3 4 and five these bits sit on the bottom I lightly season that and then lift up your steak place that on top of those bases the steak has rested beautifully I'm going to give that a nice little season over and then just a gentle season because we've exposed the meat so it's seasoned on the outside but it's not seasoned the center I love the consistency of the pepper sauce nice and Rich a little knob of butter and just let that melt in that puts a really nice sheen on the sauce and the butter actually Mellows out the pepperiness of that toasted black pepper but look the color of the fries and now check the seasoning before we sauce and then finally get a nice spoon and go over and this is where the magic starts doesn't need too much sauce but I've got crushed peppers caramelized shots the garlic pureed and a delicious set of shoe string fries and that right there is is the most amazing skirt steak with a peppercorn sauce and delicious Sho string fries thank you so much for watching now please let me know in the comments what

      "my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cereso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and get your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to the bowl i'm gonna infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chilli's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that make sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated it tastes really fishy you've got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really sumptuous rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day whether it's breads cakes tarts pies or pastries bacon is one of the most seductive skills in the kitchen it fills the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catching needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with the oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission star establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive getting to grips with bacon is just a matter of confidence slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouthwateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so\n",

      "right uh welcome home i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing burger and for me the cigarette of burger is in the blend so we've got chuck we've got the most amazing ground beef a little bit of brisket first things first season it once you've seasoned them combine them together we're binding this together with a touch of egg that sticks it together and more importantly try and get this done the day before you get this done the day before set them in the fridge so they stay nice and firm that way they don't fall apart on the grill get that grill piping hot now this is one of my most desired burgers one of my favorite burgers this is for me called the f-word burger which is actually on sale at my burger restaurant at planet hollywood in vegas now season them let the meat relax a little bit don't take them out the fridge ice cold otherwise they'll be dry on the outside and raw in the middle grill piping hot a little touch of oil on the burger to start off with this is a beautiful grapeseed oil make sure it's seasoned also roll the seasoning round the edge of the burger you know you can't season the burger after it's cooked so make sure you roll that seasoning around the outside and mop up all that seasoning gently all the burgers and then on find the hottest spot which is normally two thirds of the way up once you put burger on the grill the secret is to move it as less as possible the more you move it the more chance you've got a break in the burger and then look on now from there lid down that incorporates the heat gets a great sear on the bottom so when we come to turn those burgers they don't stick how many times have you stuck burgers on a grill and wondered why it's sticking nicely oiled quick sear and put that lid down really important now alongside my burger i'm gonna be toasting the buns why do we toast the buns we toast the bun because there's nothing worse than the soggy bun how many times you had a burger and the bun is wet if you toast that bun it gets nice and crisp and it protects the burger so salt pepper a little drizzle of oil and lightly toast those buns back up lift quick in toast those buns what goes well with the burger great cheese tomato lettuce a little bit of mustard mayonnaise and then these beauties here grilled onions peel the onion slice them lightly season them salt pepper fresh grilled onions on a burger trust me delicious easy to do absolutely phenomenal now on season them keep them whole like that that way they stop breaking up and then look i'm a firm believer in toasting both sides of my bun top and bottom onions on lid back down now look at that bun beautiful turn these bow beauties over wow the flame is the flavor okay use a long spatula a busy grill is a delicious grill so you don't cook the burger and then set up for dressing you get set up first so while the burger's cooking you get everything done first it's a really important tip why it stops the burger going cold and also you want to eat it while it's piping hot mmm look at those babies caramelize those onions love those now at my burger restaurants in las vegas we baste the burgers with devonshire butter today we're just going to lightly brush a bit of butter onto the burgers with that flame underneath it sort of caramelizes the butter and puts this wonderful flavor on top so just lightly brush a little bit of butter on there and it makes the burger so tasty now you want to become even more chefy what can you do make it a red wine butter a chipotle butter this is the basic amazing recipe for a great burger it's up to you to sort of make it your own but lightly brushing the burgers with a touch of butter two minutes before they come off so exciting look at the color of those burgers notice how there's no shrinkage there because we've got the right amount of fat in there and with this butter it makes it so flavoursome right time to flip over again literally three and a half to four minutes each side look at that that is a burger to die for and then a light brush now before they come off the grill lightly season them on the grill look from a distance the first part of the seasoning is cooked and it's inside that burger last part of the seasoning literally before you take them off really important season season season season close now for the exciting part here's the base okay that's the bum of the burger base base base three tops three bases think about how you're gonna assemble this think about once it's clutched in your hand 30 seconds before those burgers come off and i put my nice beautiful rich cheddar cheese on top so on let's go there cheese on on on remember we season underneath that so the flavor inside is gonna be incredible first off a little touch of mayonnaise this is a light mustard mayonnaise on look at that on i'm gonna go for the top as well how many times have you seen guests that have opened up a burger they tried to put ketchup or mayonnaise once you've assembled the burger you can't re-break it down you've got to put it together and eat it nice and whole so you want this oozing out the side now mayonnaise on from there take your lettuce and just lightly snap the lettuce break that in half and sort of manipulate the lettuce where it sits literally on your bun snap it break it and form the lettuce the same shape of your bun snap it break it and gently push it down from there a nice slice of tomato after that give me an s s give me an a a give me an l l give me a t salt and pepper on that tomato lightly season it beautifully done and look from there a touch more mayonnaise a touch just a touch now here's where it goes up a level look at that cheese that come on seriously beautiful on she goes number two on she goes i mean number three on she goes how do we elevate it even more how do we take that to another level look at these on seriously i mean freshly grilled onions to absolutely die for take them off caramelize the onions and then the flavor from inside that is incredible on on being generous with those onions there i'm not a big fan of raw onion on a burger it's too harsh it's too acidic and it blows the flavor of that amazing pate and then look from there on down and hold that baby in on down and on on down and in and look watch what happens look at this slice slice slice slice slice down so if you can't manage your whole one take half of one and then look we go boom boom and boom that is why i have one of the busiest households anywhere in america where you've got a neighbour like stevie wonder next door that can smell those delicious burgers kim and kanye three doors down trust me that is a burger to die for bonaba tea you\n",

get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs and things like Parsi as a rocket coriander we grow two main types of paths we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavor-wise I think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavor this is your common basil sweet Genovese this is a purple variety called Reuben with a Greek basil Thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong

now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] um time time good girl what's that one there that one's real that's right rosalie and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell mmm that's right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of plugs one two good girl put the chicken in it and you lay away you're like nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now i just want you to cut the mushrooms in

over the chicken please good girl nice put the mushrooms in not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken so we're sort of soating everything okay right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the thyme flour is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the thyme is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which ones you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so bay leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because we're

whoa whoa how cool is that magical beautiful bit like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm going to add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rump or run for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets some he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're gonna cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top and that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamberry a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just gonna turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can let out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy boku i can tell jack's going to love this is he looks the nest doesn't it smells delicious look at that i could smell that even before you took the lid off let's kill my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope that i love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee with sensational herbie sauteed potatoes and lavender creme caramel the main course will be a crispy big caesar salad but the first job are my peanut butter and jam cookies [Music] start with a cookie dough simply combine muscovado sugar peanut butter and butter until light and fluffy then add your egg a splash of milk vanilla seeds and beat again until smooth sift together salt baking powder and flour [Music] then mix until thoroughly combined [Music] in floured hands roll the cookie dough into golf ball sizes flatten and create an indent with your finger fill with half jam and half peanut butter place the cookies on a tray lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes cool before serving [Music] next job main course and my take on an iconic american salad first made almost a century ago caesar salad is definitely a classic but the trick to keeping dishes like this modern and relevant is to tweak them but not lose what made them brilliant in the first place here's my version for the ultimate american lunch my first twist is in the dressing for me the most important part of the caesar salad is that dressing rich creamy slightly spicy begin by making a basic mayonnaise start off with the egg yolks in just a little spoon dijon and then a little splash of red wine vinegar start whisking once you've got that nice slightly thickened texture drizzle in your\n",

      "the secret to making great food is to ensure you lock in every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them from the out of my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavour and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or chorizo a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley sprinkling is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs in a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the bread crumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in we'll touch the salt and pepper your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's gonna give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning nice soft texture of the meatball for that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm gonna finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so i'll cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice i've got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft and the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch to dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm going to use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in cling film set that in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which give them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling at those absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time into the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'll do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the pancetta gets lovely and crispy finely sliced leeks and add oh leek some bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down exactly what i want those leaks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor's amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it it's really nice of richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt a touch of pepper and i grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix need one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero [Music] really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters so you've got all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful [Music] and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you can left that really nice intense flavor garlic nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken stock would reduce down by half and it's almost delays at the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just gonna turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish\n",

      "I had the three piece working for delivery and then what just came in oh sorry let me just pop this in the fryer and then I will chaotic situations frier is bubbling away we are very much open for business right now so uh we're going to make this happen but it's going to be great hi I'm Eric Wang I'm the chef and founder of pecking house in Brooklyn New York today we're going to make my perfect fried [Music] rice I've trained in New York as a chef for the last 12 years I was a cook at gr's Tavern and then most recently I was was a su chef at 11 Masson Park and then when the pandemic started my family's restaurant got locked down so I started frying chicken and thus it has become my life the reason fried rice tastes different in a restaurant than the kind you have at home it's usually thanks to these very intense walk burners that look like Rocket Fuel great seasoning emulsified rice every grain is going to be covered in a light slick of oil and then high heat that's the flavor we're trying to cultivate by using these really intense walks over here so this is going to be a chicken fried rice just like the one that my mom makes in her restaurant the one I grew up in and the first step is to marinate the chicken with a Technique we call velveting velveting is a technique to prepare proteins for stir fries it really improves their texture keeps them really moist and gives them a nice bouncy texture so egg whites obviously have protein and they are slightly alkaline and that alkaline texture is actually going to tenderize the protein a little bit and that's what gives those stir fry ingredients you get in your Chinese takeout that unique texture okay um CH sandwich swi P that sandwich chilio okay so we're going to cut this into very thin strips this is chicken breast boneless skinless you can use chicken thigh you can use whatever you want we're aiming for kind of like needly consistency not quite spaghetti but maybe a little thicker than that what should we say butini so normally in a Chinese restaurant at least how we would do it at my mom's place we would freeze these slice them on a deli slicer and then cut them into strips it's a little harder to do with fresh chicken why is Chinese cuisine such thin portions of me whereas like a lot of Western cooking is these giant roast and such like that I learned recently is because China is considered quite poor in fuel as in like wood and uh combustible fuel so they generally prepare things to be cooked as quickly as possible whereas there were a great deal of forest in Europe and that's why you can create these big fires and big bread and such and such my mom would probably tell me to cut these thinner but you know this is what we're doing here it'll cook very quickly so we have our chicken strips We're going to add a little salt some cornstarch corn starch is going to allow the protein to hold on to a little bit of moisture by hydrating and then we're going to add a little baking soda again alkalinity is going to tenderize proteins a little bit this is going to give it the texture of that great Chinese American dish chicken and broccoli that really nice slippery and bouncy texture of a thinly sliced piece of chicken that is not a achievable unless you do this step okay so we have our chicken velvety we're going to put this away for a second and then we're going to address the [Music] rice so D rice is the key to fried rice it's the history you know using leftover rice how would you bring it back to life and make it something delicious it is crystalized the starches in it have made it hard but it makes it great for stir fry cuz it's going to be really loose and fluffy it's going to hold on the fat for a little bit and that's what gives grap fried rice this awesome texture so this would be rice that is drying out overnight we got racks and racks and racks of it and as you see after we fluff it we pack in these containers and then we get ready to Fred rice during service at home since you're doing a small quantity I wouldn't worry about it too much if you got it that white takeout carton you just didn't finish your rice from your takeout meal the night before it'll be totally fine ready to fry the next day we use jasmine rice in the restaurant all varieties of rice contain a measure of amope pcin it's Ultra exaggerated in risoto rice that makes it really sticky and creamy and then there's less of it in long grain rice which is why it's nice and drier and fluffy and like in individual grains this is very much a really important step fluffing the rice cooking your rice the day before at least then taking the time the next day to run through it massage it all into these beautiful little fluffy grains so if you're making fried rice at home and you see that it has become a congealed clumpy Mass unappetizing it is because you have skipped this step and your ancestors would be disappointed yeah you run out of rice what do you do oh man you're screwed dude you're fo my mom's going to yell at you you can use fresh rice what you could do is you could use slightly less water when you're cooking your rice that will prevent it from being super sticky so you would get something that's a little closer to the ideal texture of fried rice so our rice is fluffed lovingly going to put this in a separate container if I was really slick I would do the parchment slide but I don't trust myself on camera let's see please hold yeah so we're going to prep the rest of our ingredients it's really important when making fried rice any sort of stir fry uh that everything is as close to ready as possible most things that cook and walk they only take about 45 seconds to a minute it happens really fast so it's really important that you have everything ready you're well prepared and then you're off to the raises all right we're going to make our eggs we're going to scramble them up and it's a very inexpensive and easy way to add protein to the dish it just has a wonderful texture to it obviously they're not going to be creamy scrambled they're going to be kind of firmly set but it eats really well with all the fluffy rice that we're going to make I said fluffy how many times today so we're going to beat them all out whisk them nicely and get them ready for our fried rice some would say I should use chopsticks believe it or not I don't have Chopsticks in this restaurant great dishonor and shame we're going to dice some onion up when you're stir frying vegetables even for fried rice you don't want them to be too soft we want to texture that it still has a little bit of bite it's not too mushy so can't be too small can Lopez calls it Tender Crisp I think that's a great term I don't add garlic to fried rice I think it's a little much everyone thinks like anytime you cook something Chinese it has to have garlic ginger and scallions in it that's not true then we're going to do our scallions going to separate them into the dark green and then the light green and the whites are going to go together we're going to cook these first they're a little bit more pungent but they're going to add a really nice foundation and savoriness to it and then we're just going to finish with the dark green part so as color has pungency has Aroma my mom has a Chinese restaurant on Long Island her original restaurant was in Queen it was called peeking house her and my father were servers there the owner sold it to my parents I grew up taking phone calls takeout orders reservations busting tables learned a lot about life also going in this thing we got peas and carrots very classic for Chinese takeout restaurants and adds a really nice bit of color and texture we're going to add soy sauce to our fried rice to add salinity to add Umami savoriness you're going to add the soy sauce around the edge just so it Cooks down a little bit reduces just very slightly you don't want it to be too wet but you do also want to add all that color Aroma and salinity there's a very specific technique when you're stir frying things you're adding your seasonings your liquid seasonings along the edge of the pan the only other seasonings besides soy sauce salt and MSG you can't have grap fried rice without some degree of MSG it is simply a salt it is glutamates it's what activates in your tongue and your brain to develop that flavor of savoriness what Japanese people call Umami and you should have in your home it's very useful so we like to add a little butter to our fried rice not traditional but rice and butter are great friends it works really well you just need a little bit kind of brings the whole party together ties the room together if you will okay we got everything ready to go here again this is come together really quickly and we're going to make some fried rice all right we got our chicken velveted here I'm going to do a pass through and the idea here is to set the texture cook the chicken through obviously before we stirfry everything so we have everything ready beforehand then the rice comes together very quickly it's called the pasture just because you're cooking it very quickly usually you just pass it through hot oil because you have this like almost paper thin slice of protein it Cooks in like 30 seconds we can also do it in water it just changes the fat content of where you're trying to cook if you're stir frying something you might want that oil but since fried rice we're going to add oil and we can just use water unlike in Western cooking you're not trying to get a fond by searing chicken in a walk or a pan or anything like that you just want everything cooked ahead of time you get all the color and the flavor from the soy sauce and the other seasonings if you didn't velvet your chicken you don't need to do a past through you could cook it in the pan beforehand that's totally fine we are cooking this in a walk as it would be done in a Chinese restaurant a very thin sheet of either cast iron or carbon steel and uh it doesn't retain heat very long because it's very thin but it does transfer very quickly which is why we have these massive jet burners we're looking for something called wak ha it's uh the Cantonese term literally translates to breath of the walk it's that really intense heat that almost Char flavor that you have to a lot of great Chinese cuisine that's difficult to replicate at homes it's from the intense heat that's combusting the fats in your fried rice and your stir fries all oils have a smoke point point and you can achieve that very quickly by tossing food through the fire of a walk burner it's lightly smoky it's lightly charred and it's it tastes like intense heat if you believe it or not if you have a gas burner you can be tossing your food through the gas burner as we'll see in the stir fry technique but if failing that you could also use a blowtorch all right we have a two ring cantones burner here for this big walk here we need this walk super hot we want the oil to be smoking the second it hits the pen as you can see it's already starting to smoke going on onions little bit of eggs you want to add the eggs first so that they set you don't want to add them on top of the rice cuz then it emulsifies with the rice it's an entirely different product everything happens really quickly we set the eggs first and then everything comes together all right we're going on Rice we're rocking it against the the sides so that we're cradling it against the flame as much as we can enough oil so that the fried rice has a bit of a shine we're tossing it over the flame over the gas [Music] burner a noisy Affair all right then we're going to go in with our other seasonings park it for one second going to do some peas and carrots scallions salt and a little bit of MSG fire it up again you always want it to be in motion otherwise it's going to burn a little bit that's not what you want you want charred flavor but you don't want to burn your ingredients soy sauce again we're adding it around the side of the pan so caramelizes immediately you want it to reduce just ever so slightly as you're making it just as we're almost finishing I'm just going to add the smallest bit of butter it's going to give it a little shine just my personal touch you can kind of learn by experience with the texture and how it falls the grains are no longer hard they're not bouncing around the walk they're almost moving with it in a wave motion that's kind of how you know that it's ready all right this is how you want to be eating your fried rice when it's hot steaming almost going to burn your mouth nice individual grains no clumps everything's kind of the same size if you eat it with one bite that's good oh hot has that um really lovely texture individual grains light but still has like a light slick of oil to everything peas are nice onions still have a little texture chicken is really silky and bouncy at the same time to me it has just the right amount of salt and MSG it does have that kind of like lightly Smoky Aroma that's really important otherwise fried\n",

      "Hi guys, I am Luciano Monosilio The chef and owner of Luciano Cucina Italiana The restaurant in the centre of Rome Our restaurant is very famous for one dish The Carbonara Today I am going to show you how to make my home recipe We have very simple ingredients And then we are going to mix all these ingredients together We will start first from the Guanciale After black pepper Then eggs Parmesan cheese and Pecorino cheese We blend, we mix the cheese It's very important to clean the Guanciale We remove all the black pepper on top and also the skin at the back And then, when the Guanciale is clean We start to cut the Guanciale We make small cubes This has to be the size of Guanciale It is very important because We are going to cook the Guanciale with its fat We don't use olive oil, butter, anything Just Guanciale That's it With the Guanciale already cut We go on the fire If we have gas, we use the iron pan If you don't have gas and use induction, you can use an non-stick pan That is very important for cooking properly the Guanciale The we start with the fire. First we put the fire very high So we warm up the pan When the pan is warm... We put the fire on low We are going in with the Guanciale We can hear it starts frying very low heat When the Guanciale is cooking, we going to make the sauce with the eggs Now we start to make the egg sauce for the Carbonara In my recipe I use only the yolks, the red part of the eggs I use one egg per person If the eggs are small, I use three, one and a half per person Like in this case You see now, the Guanciale starts frying in the pan Grana Padano (Parmesan) And Pecorino When you make the cheese, I suggest to mix Pecorino and Grana Padano (Parmesan) Because the Pecorino sometimes is very salty I suggest to mix to balance the flavor with the Grana Padano So it is less salty That's why we use 2 parts of Pecorino and 1 part of Grana Padano To make Carbonara we use this kind of pan It's called 'Bagno Maria' Later I will show you why we use this type of pan. Cheese Eggs And black pepper See the Guanciale It's crispy outside And should be very soft inside With this fat we make the sauce We put half of this one in the egg sauce And the we remove completely the fat An then we can save the Guanciale And now we mix the sauce We put some pasta water To make our Carbonara we use Spaghetti It's very important that the boiling water is salted but not too much So we put very little salt When the water is boiling We put the Spaghetti And now we have to wait - 12 minutes So guys, we are almost ready We have three minutes left and then we will check the pasta It's very important that the pasta is cooked properly Especially for this recipe we don't do the pasta 'al dente' Because we need the pasta to be cooked properly. It has to be soft because after I show you how to make the Carbonara with the 'Bagno Maria' We check We are ready Some boiling water And now we will wait We cook the pasta in the 'Bagno Maria' because we have the very right temperature like that we cook the eggs very gently we have to have a temperature of 65 degrees centigrade with this technique the eggs with the cheese should be very creamy And then, now we put the Guanciale inside. It's very important the Guanciale has to be hot. Now it is room temperature Some more black pepper And then we prepare the plate We have decided to make this plate for the Carbonara It's a special plate It's not a normal plate, because on the back you have the recipe of the Carbonara The eggs start to be very creamy Now it is ready Now And then we finish the Carbonara with Guanciale on top Some cream And then we finish with the Pecorino cheese on top And black pepper Pecorino cheese And black pepper And that's it: our Carbonara is ready This place is the house of Carbonara Our recipe is very special, because we have decided to make the Carbonara in a different way We try to find a very good balance from the Guanciale and the pasta And also we make very good... flavor of cheese The new generation doesn't like the Pecorino cheese because it is too salty. Actually sometimes it's spicy So we have decided to balance it with the Grana (Parmesan) because first for the flavors to make it more light and after, because Grana is a very creamy cheese the Grana helps us to how to make this cream of our Carbonara You can see it looks like with cream inside but there is no cream inside I hope you are going to enjoy For everything, you just call me up\n",

      "some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're going to soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet to slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crisper it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier [Music] this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken [Music] with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first [Music] salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan can see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked [Music] make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there [Music] now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and you see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavour on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] so smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated piles and cheese give your veg some attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is new york cheesecake because it's baked it says no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate [Music] the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] you\n",

looks smells and feels really good and if you get the chance and taste it before you buy it a great-tasting salad starts with fantastic salad leaves and when it comes to all things green there's little dr. Steve ruffle doesn't know I think I am obsessed with South I'm obsessed primarily with watercress that's in my heart Castillo got a PhD of watercress a doctorate in salad we should all take a leaf out his book then he's not only been studying sudden leaves for over 30 years he's been growing them so he really knows he's rocket from his romaine there are literally thousands of varieties of salad things like the Tavian lettuce red veined spinach wild rocket sorrel we grow virtually everything outdoors and and we follow the seasons so we're not forcing the leaves we don't give them too much fertilizer or irrigation we try to grow them a little bit slower and that's the way to get the best flavor and the best quality of leaf will harvest a crop cut it in the morning it's then on the road going out to customers to be on the Shelf the next day this is a great leaf baby leaf spinach and we call it baby leaf yeah quite literally because we cut it when it's still at a baby stage these are baby pea shoots we'll put something like three or four hundred pea seeds into the seed bed and then in as little as 12 14 days they've grown to a sort of a crop like this they've got the flavor of fresh peas a bit of sweetness and they and they got a really nice soft velvety leaf texture this is baby watercress which is my favorite salad crop of them all watercress is special because by definition it's grown in pure flowing water fresh watercress has got that fantastic pungent peppery flavor in Victorian London it was known as poor man's bread whereby a lot of workers would start the day with a watercress sandwich and if they couldn't afford bread they just ate the watercress straight it is an amazing full of flavor I can't eat enough sell it obsessed thieves spot on there's hundreds of salad leaves available with different textures tastes and colors here are five my favorite everyday salad leaves and don't forget some of them are delicious cooked - little gem sweet and crisp and an amazingly dense heart these many cause lettuces are great simply braised in the oven or use the leaves as scoops for delicious chili beef filling mustard leaves pungent spicy and full of vitamin C these are a staple in Asian dishes and are fantastic stir fried or steamed lambs leaf full of tangy flavor and with incredible springy stems great for hearty robust salads or simply paired with fish for a healthier simple supper rocket these distinctive peppery leaves are actually classed as a herb and are perfect in soups or with fruits and are full of iron finally chicory or on leave these tightly packed red or white leaves have a deliciously bitter taste and are great wrapped in ham or alongside shine blue cheeses I think when you're shopping for salads you can just shop with your eyes you know if it looks fresh and healthy tasty it is you want to look for bright colors I like to see leaves with a bit of moisture on them sounds like to be kept cold and moist basically so when you buy a packaged salad put it in the fridge and if you don't use it all in one go roll up the bag to exclude surplus air put it back in the fridge keep it cold there's so much choice of writing out there I really do think people should be more adventurous in their choice of salads here both what they choose to try and eat and and what they do with them so get yourself some ingredients use them boldly and your studded leaves can really take center stage next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips dorbz are a fantastic ingredient when you want a special salad that really impresses here's how to prepare them do not be intimidated trying to get the scallop out i'ma show you how easy it is to take them out and how much more exciting is to get them fresh in the shell so just face it the dessert spoon and a blunt knife put the knife in to the bottom and you just twist open till the knife up set doesn't cut into the scallop meat run the knife on the top to the base off with a lid no flesh on there and then from there that's cool just scallops skirt all you do is just peel that forward and get the spoon to run down the back of the shell and the idea is to remove that little bit of muscle that holds the scallop on to the bottom shelf bang it pops out that's the top the small side of the bottom there's the muscle there and your thumb just slides neatly in there and run your fingers round and you just pop out Scott up and look bang beautiful this bit here is called the skirt no use doesn't taste everything now that's the coral you can slice that off dry it in the oven and use it as a powder for your risottos or even seasoning fish with but that's their money these just need to be rinsed under cold water dried and ready for the pan tomatoes are another salad staple his how to skin them for extra refinement score each one with a cross at the bottom blanch in boiling water for a minute then shot them in cold water and the skins will easily peel away pomegranates are a fabulous fruit by adding glamour to salads or desserts the trick to getting the seeds out slice in half lengthways makes its around the edge turn upside down over a bowl and using a large spoon whack as hard as you can to release the seeds to take fabulous fruit puts the next level my tip is to add sophisticated cornell's of ice cream or lemon mascarpone simply dip two metal spoons in hot water scoop shape and add and after baking never throw out your leftover pastry it's easy transformed into grapefruit or savory party nibbles roll out break Parmesan or sprinkle over your favorite fruit roll and then just slice and bake [Music] as any chef knows at the end of a meal you want to leave your guests on a high with a spectacular dessert so when you're cooking for a special occasion and want to make an impact it's great to have a fabulous fruit dessert up your sleeve [Music] my last recipe looks sensational and tastes just as good raspberry milfoil desserts should always have that wow factor and this dish is incredibly simple to prepare but it tastes and looks absolutely stunning first off puff pastry you can buy fabulous puff pastry now a non-stick baking tray and just lay the puff pastry on the tray I want to get the top of the puff pastry camera eyes so we're going to dust it in icing sugar now move 40 means a thousand layers just lightly dust the top of the puff pastry with icing sugar we're gonna start off in a hot oven at 220 for the first six or seven minutes and then ten minutes at 190 into the oven now for the filling fresh vanilla cream in you start whisking what the cream whisk nice and thick but look at all that nice fresh vanilla seeds in there next a nice scraping of orange zest all right look cure don't whisk that in\n",

      "an American Airlines flight has collided midair with a helicopter a military helicopter in Washington DC the US Federal Aviation Administration said it happened whilst on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 900 p.m. local time the jet we understand was carrying 60 passengers and four crew whilst three US Army soldiers were on board the Black Hawk military helicopter president Donald Trump says that he's been briefed on what he has described as the terrible accident and went on to thank emergency responders for their incredible work police divers and boats have been searching the water now for a number of hours looking for survivors whilst the US Federal authorities have begun their investigation okay let's cross to our correspondent Live From The Scene maril Thomas Marilyn you're there Merlin you're there first off um just take us through the timeline of what happened so what we know is that a commercial airline the American Airlines collided midair with an army Blackhawk helicopter and as you said there were 60 passengers on board the commercial airline as well as four crew members and there were also three soldiers on board the helicopter as well and just in the last few minutes as well we've seen reports that at least 18 bodies were recovered uh from the river that's according to our official Partners CBS but just to say there are there is no official update on the number of casualties as of yet and this is still a developing story but that Collision occurred here uh at around 9900 p.m. local time uh and it happened midair and it um it happened as the commercial airline was on its approach to Runway 33 and the scene that you can see behind me is the airport itself so you can see the the blue and red Sirens behind me and the Blackness to my left and that is the river as you can see here and there is a flurry of activity as the emergency operation is underway we know that there are uh emergency divers and police boats and emergency rescue operations very much underway but just to remind you it's midnight here local time and so it's extremely cold and it's dark and that will make that uh rescue operation all that much harder uh and you know we're constantly seeing more and more official um police cars and emergency responders arriving at this airport uh and we are expecting to hear a press conference in about half an hour and we'll expect more updates regularly throughout the night as well okay Merlin let's just uh go back to the the crash itself um I understand that there has been some audio that's been released um from Air Traffic Control um we are waiting for for more information on that but what have eyewitnesses described in the minutes leading up to that crash we've spoken to people here at the scene um and they didn't want to be named but one did tell me that they actually witnessed the moment of the Collision itself so they saw the fireball uh of the Collision itself and it was a bright orange in the sky and then it fell uh down into what this person uh thought was the river and he heard a loud uh boom sound as the Collision happened um and he described to me how scared and terrified he was um that he wanted to fall to his knees just watching um the moment happen before him couldn't quite believe his eyes um and so there's very much a lot of confusion here and people have been arriving at the airport um trying to find out what's happening um some people who have arrived expecting their their loved ones to arrive on other flights which have now been um re rooted to other airports all flights have been ground um to a halt here there are no flights taking off or Landing here um at all in the next few hours at least um that we know of um but we'll expect to hear more updates as we go through the night um more regularly okay so let me just reiterate what Merlin has told us there is a ground stop it's referred to as a ground stop this is a traffic management initiative which means that aircraft that meet specific criteria criteria need to remain on their on the ground at their origin origination Airport so there is a ground stop in place at Reagan National Airport no flights coming in no flights coming out Merlin there are two helicopters that are operating in the area and this is part of the search and uh rescue that is taking place at the moment what exactly are those helicopters doing what can you see them doing they have I'm I presume very bright spotlights on board what have you seen [Music] yeah I can hear them weing above me now you can hear that sound um and they are just monitoring the situation and we know that there are lots and lots of emergency responders on site dozens of fire trucks and and police um attending to the scene as well as U divers which have been sent from uh neighboring states like Maryland as well uh which H which are part of the rescue operation and we also know that the US Coast Guard is also involved in this operation as well and this will be a massive operation um and it will will be made all the more difficult by the fact that it is extremely cold here the temperature is cold even in the air and so it'll be even um colder in the water as well where this rescue operation is ongoing as we speak yeah I mean it it's it's only a matter of it's what a week just over a week that we had the inauguration of Donald Trump and because of that truly frigid weather it was moved indoors what are the conditions like along the river itself at the moment was it was it frozen over the pomac river Upstream it is it is frozen in Parts here it's hard to see because it's so dark it's it's just past midnight it's very dark here um and as I say it is very cold and so those rescue divers and this police will be operating in very frigid cold conditions and as you said uh you know we've had a spell of that here in DC and that is exactly what um prompted the inauguration to be moved indoors and so you know the city is just recovering from that and so there will be some of the river will still be frozen over we've seen elsewhere some of the tidal Bas in other bodies of water in the city here are still frozen over and you know just it was just a few days ago that there was still snow and ice um on these streets as well so the temperatures are very cold and the conditions are very difficult\n",

      "and to the United States where an investigation has been launched after a passenger jet collided with a US military helicopter while Landing in Washington DC Rescuers have begun to search the river pomac uh nearby for survivors 67 people were on board the two aircraft at the time of the crash rescue boats searching the freezing pomac River for survivors both aircraft plunged into the icy waterway that cuts through Washington DC after to colliding in midair this footage from an EarthCam TV live stream captures the moment when the passenger plane and military helicopter hit and fell out of the sky the American Airlines flight from Kansas was on its way to land at Ronald Reagan National Airport when the crash occurred the US Army said that its helicopter was on a training Mission at the time divers are scouring the river for survival ders 64 people were on the plane and three on the helicopter but officials said the conditions were extremely difficult the water that we're operating in is about 8 ft deep um there is wind there is pieces of ice out there so it it's just dangerous and hard to work in and because there's not a lot of lights you're out there searching every square inch of space to see if you can find anybody the divers are doing the same thing in the water the water is dark it is murky um and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in investigations into how the Collision happened in some of the most heavily monitored airspace in the world just a few kilometers from the US capital are underway you president Trump has already taken to social media to criticize air traffic control for the crash saying that it should have been prevented let's pick up uh some of those points with uh journalist Matthew kuchi who joins us from Washington DC welcome Matthew let's start with that that that point about this being a a a busy uh airport um a a military helicopter and a civilian passenger jet which just absolutely a collision like this should not happen yeah most definitely you know this airspace is among the most busy and crowded in the world but also the most heavily regulated Reagan National Airport has about 25 million passengers fly through every single year but notice it's not a very big airport only three runways at any given point two are in use at the same time for the most part and yet they constantly churn through considerable volume most other major airports in the US might have three four or five runways so they do a lot with a little space factor in the fact that it's only 3 kilometers south of downtown DC with the White House the capital the Washington Monument just right over there lots of executive flights the president flying in and out lots of military exercises to it's a lot to keep track of and for years folks have said maybe the airspace is a little bit too busy maybe too many moving Parts it appears that may have been a factor tonight um what is being said about potential causes well just to give folks a bit of a bearing the pic river runs north to south the main Runway at Reagan National is 7,000 ft long it also runs north to south that's Runway one that usually Services the 3X3 three seat by3 seat bigger planes however smaller Regional Jet that are two seat by two seat sometimes use the shorter runways because they can there is a shorter Runway number 33 that goes Southeast to Northwest on nights like tonight when the wind is blowing out of the Northwest Pilots like to land that direction because it's better with lift as they start to land now for that to occur the planes have to sort of loop on the east side of the pomac and then turn to the left at the last minute that's what the plane did tonight it was cleared to land on Runway 33 however per Air Traffic Control there was that military helicopter that was told to essentially wait let the plane go by then follow behind the military helicopter acknowledged that it saw the plane but the fact that the Collision occurred indicates that perhaps the military aircraft was looking at the wrong plane or there was some sort of lapse of judgment this happened at night in the middle of winter and the Jet fell into a a river which sounds like a serious challenge for Rescuers most definitely you know the biggest fact factor that we ask all the time is to what extent did weather contribute to an accident like this you know meteorology and Aviation often times intersect as you all know I'm your meteorologist but you know I have to say tonight the weather at least for Aviation was great visibility was phenomenal the winds were relatively light so it doesn't seem like for the actual crash itself that was a factor at all however now for the search and rescue and potentially recovery Mission it's a huge obstacle temperatures right now are down around 4 30° fhe probably 4 or 5 degre C if that water temperatures are 35.8 de F or roughly two degrees Celsius so hypothermia would set in in minutes at the same time there's ice that is actually propagating along the pomac and so the fact that this accident occurred roughly 8ish hours ago would to me say that at this point we're likely not really looking at a rescue mission this is now a recovery Mission and so far there have been no confirmed reports of survivors it's difficult to not lose optimism and how will the investigation into this crash be handled well in the United States we have something called the NTSB the national Transportation safety Bureau that is tasked with reviewing all the data all the Angles and trying to figure out what potential causes there were contributing to this accident they're already on scene they are sort of serendipitously located in DC and so they're basically already here they'll be working in tanem with the FAA to interview both air traffic control and potentially eyewitnesses to coming through footage and then of course the black boxes the cockpit voice recorders uh the the data on board the plane but really uh I have sort of a sneaking suspicion that this investigation will sort of be a quicker one compared to other ones simply because we know the the passenger plane was cleared to land it was doing what it was supposed to do this looks like on every count an incursion or sort of a a trip to where it wasn't supposed to be of this helicopter a sort of you know not following instructions or deviating from where it should have gone okay thank you for talking us through that so clearly Matthew journalist Matthew kuchi in Washington DC thank you\n",

      "firstly we've got an aircraft that that that is involved in an explosion a midair Collision there was an explosion a fireball at 350 ft above the water so it plummets down then it sinks into freezing coold water the chances of survival from that are a remote I would say and indications are at this very minute is that there are few if any survivors from this terrible tragedy my analysis is that the crj700 the American Airlines flight was complying with air traffic control directions to land at Reagan National Airport on the pic River the Blackhawk helicopter US Army um had taken off in close proximity and it had made six course changes as it climbed in altitude before it impacted the crj at about 350 ft um off the pomac river what that tells me is that it this was a training Flight of the helicopter uh it apparently did not have its adsb tracking uh system turned on this is is the signal that's sent out to air traffic control to track aircraft and it also is a vital component of another system called tcast which is traffic collision avoidance system fitted to all commercial aircraft and and military aircraft which alerts them to other aircraft on a collision course but the adsb must be turned on it's quite possible that this training flight of this Blackhawk helicopter was a a covert style training mission of going black if you like not having any electronic tracking turned on and tragic tragic eror um of doing this around you around an airport an active airport I mean if they're going to do that sort of training it should be done well away from an active airport like like Reagan national uh I would expect that they will have the black boxes recovered within 24 hours if not earlier they will have them read and analyzed I believe that we'll get a lot of detail uh within the next uh s to 14 days about what happened\n",

AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY SURVIVORS FROM THIS ACCIDENT. AND WE HAVE RECOVERED 27 PEOPLE FROM THE PLANE AND ONE FROM THE HELICOPTER.

THIS AGAIN, ACCORDING TO THE SKATING CONFIRMS THAT, QUOTE, SEVERAL MEMBERS OF ITS COMMUNITY, INCLUDING ATHLETES, COACHES AND FAMILY MEMBERS, WERE COMING HOME FROM A CAMP HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS IN WICHITA, WHICH ENDED ON SUNDAY. WE ALSO JUST HEARD FROM THE CEO OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, HE SAYS. AT THIS POINT, THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH IS STILL NOT KNOWN. IT COLLIDED WITH A MILITARY AIRCRAFT ON AN OTHERWISE NORMAL APPROACH. AND AT THIS TIME, WE DON'T KNOW WHY THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT CAME INTO THE PATH OF THE PSA AIRCRAFT.

SOME OF THE DETAILS ABOUT WHO WAS ON THAT PLANE AND MUCH OF THE ATTENTION SO FAR THIS MORNING, CAROLINE, IS FOCUSING ON THE U.S. NATIONAL FIGURE SKATING PROGRAM.

U.S. FIGURE SKATING SAYS THERE WERE SEVERAL SKATERS ON THAT PLANE. THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK FROM A NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAMP WHICH WAS IN WICHITA, KANSAS. IT ALSO COINCIDED WITH THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS WHICH WERE ALSO HELD IN KANSAS, AS YOU MENTIONED, THEIR COACHES AND FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ALSO ON THAT PLANE. NOW, THE GOVERNING BODY ISSUED A STATEMENT TODAY. IT SAID WE ARE DEVASTATED BY THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY AND HOLD THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES CLOSELY IN OUR HEARTS.

THEY WON THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN PAIRS FIGURE SKATING IN 1994. THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES FOR SOME TIME AND WERE COACHING YOUNG ICE SKATERS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO TOOK TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TRUTH SOCIAL, HIS POST, HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT TONE.

THE LIGHTS ON THE PLANE WERE BLAZING. WHY DIDN'T THE HELICOPTER GIVE UP OR DOWN OR TURN, WHY DIDN'T THE CONTROL TOWER TELL THE HELICOPTER WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF ASKING IF THEY SAW THE PLANE. THIS IS A BAD SITUATION THAT LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED, NOT GOOD. HE ALSO POSTED WHAT A TERRIBLE NIGHT, GOD BLESS YOU ALL. >> Heather: CAROLINE, THANK YOU. JUST STAY WITH ME AND WE'LL PAUSE AND BE BACK WITH YOU A\n",

      "E ARE TALKING ABOUT LIVE ATC WE TALKED FROM JOHN SCOTT AND YOU MENTIONED IN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TOWER AND BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER THEY WERE A HUNDRED MESSAGES SENT AS FOX NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THEY DID RESPOND TO THE TOWER READING THE QUOTE THAT THEY DID NOT RESPOND AND THEY ASKED AT THE OTHER REGIONAL JET INSIGHT AND IT APPEARS AND AS JON SCOTT WAS LAYING IT OUT FOR US ON THE ATC TRANSCRIPT RIGHT NOW GETTING THE CLARITY ON THIS AND THE WARNING WAS A BIT STRONG BUT THERE WERE TWO DIRECTIONS GIVEN FROM THE TOWER WITH DID YOU SEE THE REGIONAL JET THAT'S THE TRANSCRIPT THAT WHAT COUNTRY DID NOT RESPOND AND I WANT TO BRING JON SCOTT BACK IN IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THAT FOX IS REPORTING THAT THEY DID RESPOND BUT ON A DIFFERENT TOWER FREQUENCY. THEY WERE ON A FREQUENCY FOR HELICOPTERS AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE TOWER CONTROLLER WAS WORKING BOTH FREQUENCIES WHICH IS WHY IN THE CONVERSATION YOU ARE LISTENING TO YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HEAR HER RESPONSE NOR DID ANY OF THE PILOTS WE TALKED TO TODAY. >> WE USED THIS FREQUENCY PRIMARILY FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE EQUIPPED WITH THESE FREQUENCIES WILL WHERE JETLINERS AND THE AVIATION AIRCRAFT USED. IT COULD BE WAS ON A HELICOPTER FREQUENTLY THERE AND MAY BE TALKING TO THE TOWER AND NOT GETTING THE TRANSMISSION THROUGH. THAT IS ALL PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. AND SPEAKING OF THE INVESTIGATION I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD THIS BUT WE WILL PLAY IT TWICE THIS IS THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER TALKING TO THE BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER WE WILL PLAY FOR YOU A COUPLE TIMES AND WE WILL LISTEN TO THIS IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT TO HEAR THEIR AND DID YOU SEE THAT AND DID YOU SEE THAT. IT IS A BIT SURPRISING. >> I DO BELIEVE IT TO BE ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WHO SAW THE EXPLOSION AND WHAT HAPPENS IS I TOOK A MINUTE TO LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE AFTER THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE AND YES, HE DOES FIRST SAY TO THAT DO YOU HAVE THE CRG INSIGHT AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GOING BEHIND AND FLY BEHIND THE REGIONAL JET. AND THE COLLISION TAKES PLACE IN LESS THAN FIVE SECONDS WITH THE LAST TRANSITION. >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT BUT THE HELICOPTER PILOT OR ONE OF THEM DIDN'T RESPOND BEING RESUMED IN THAT WINDOW BEFORE THIS DIRECTION'S THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TOWER ARE SO ARE SO RAPID-FIRE AND HE GETS ON BASICALLY IMMEDIATELY IF HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OR EVEN ON A DIFFERENT BAND UHF BAND AND THE TOWER WAS IN HEARING WHATEVER THE CHOPPER WAS SAYING IN THE YEARS COVERING AVIATION ANALYSIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME, THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND JUST SO WE CAN GET A CLEAR VISION OF THIS THE HELICOPTER HITS THE PLANE AND THEY BOTH GO DOWN. NOW WE KNOW AS WE ARE WAITING FOR A NEWS CONFERENCE ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN SET FOR 12:30 AND 24 SECONDS EAST COAST TIME AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A WORD OF THAT BEING MOVED UPPER BACK OR CANCEL. IT STILL APPEARS TO BE NOT ON SCHEDULE PER SE BUT HAPPENING AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THE PLANE HOWEVER WAS HIT BY THE HELICOPTER AND THEY BOTH GO INTO THE WATER. NOW WE LEARN THAT THOSE AIRCRAFT ARE BOTH IN THE POTOMAC AND AT THE HELICOPTER IS UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU HAVE THE PLANE WHICH IS BROKEN IN AT LEAST TWO PIECES WHICH ARE BE\n",

      "SO THIS IS A STATE AND FEDERAL RESPONSE AS WELL. TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO ON YOUR SCREENS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE MOMENT THE AIRLINER IN THE MILITARY HELICOPTER CRASHED INTO EACH OTHER. RIGHT NOW, BOTH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD ARE INVESTIGATING THIS CRASH. WE ARE NOW LEARNING FIGURE SKATING. ATHLETES WERE AMONG THOSE ON BOARD THE PASSENGER FLIGHT THAT COLLIDED MID-AIR WITH A MILITARY HELICOPTER RIGHT NEAR REAGAN AIRPORT. NOW, U.S. FIGURE SKATING RELEASED A STATEMENT CONFIRMING THAT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THEIR SKATING COMMUNITY WERE ON BOARD THAT AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 5342. ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THE ATHLETES, COACHES AND FAMILY MEMBERS WERE RETURNING HOME FROM THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAMP HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE U.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS IN WICHITA, KANSAS. THE STATEMENT WENT ON TO SAY THE ORGANIZATION IS DEVASTATED BY THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY. THE FLIGHT WAS CARRYING 60 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS. THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER. WE ARE IN TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING WITH 11 NEWS ANCHOR SEAN STREICHER AT BWI, TRACKING HOW FLIGHTS WILL BE IMPACTED THIS MORNING. BUT FIRST, WE START WITH 11 NEWS REPORTER JENNIFER FRANCIOTTI, WHO IS LIVE AT THE SCENE IN THE ARLINGTON AREA WHERE LAST NIGHT’S CRASH HAPPENED. JEN, WE’VE HEARD FROM SOME OFFICIALS EVERY HOUR SINCE ABOUT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT. WHAT IS THE NEWEST INFORMATION WE KNOW RIGHT NOW? WELL, THE LATEST IS UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAVE RECOVERED BODIES, UPWARDS OF 19 BODIES HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM THE POTOMAC RIVER. BUT THIS IS NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT THEY COULD STILL FIND SURVIVORS. I’M GOING TO SET UP THE SCENE HERE TO TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE. WE’RE AT GRAVELLY POINT PARK, WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE POTOMAC. AS I STEP OUT OF THE WAY, THIS IS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON PARKWAY. WE’RE ON THE SOUTHBOUND SIDE. THE NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC WOULD BE THEN HEADING AWAY FROM YOU TOWARD THE LEFT PORTION OF YOUR SCREEN AND ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER. THERE YOU SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONDER VEHICLES. WHAT YOU’RE NOT ABLE TO SEE IS THE WATER. FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT, WE SEE HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR. AND THEN TO THE RIGHT PORTION OF YOUR SCREEN WHERE YOU SEE WHITE BRIGHT LIGHTS. THAT’S REAGAN NATIONAL. IT’S BASICALLY WHERE THE PLANE AND THE HELICOPTER WENT DOWN IN THE RIVER IS WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE OF THE RUNWAY. THAT’S HOW CLOSE THIS WAS. AND AS YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OF THE PLANE COMING IN, YOU COULD SEE IT WAS AT A VERY LOW ALTITUDE AS IT WAS COMING IN TOWARD THE RUNWAY. AND THEN YOU SEE THAT BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER BASICALLY JUST COLLIDE RIGHT INTO IT, AND YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION IN THE AIR, AND THEN THE DEBRIS FALLING INTO THE RIVER BELOW. SO THIS ALL UNFOLDED AROUND 9:00 LAST NIGHT. AND THAT’S WHEN THAT FLIGHT FROM WICHITA, 5342, THE AMERICAN EAGLE REGIONAL PASSENGER PLANE WAS FLYING HERE. AND IT INVOLVED THIS COLLISION WITH THE MILITARY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, WAS INVOLVED IN A TRAINING EXERCISE. NOW, AS FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE ON BOARD, WE’RE TOLD THE NUMBER THERE 6460 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS ON THE PLANE. AND THE ARMY SAYS THREE SOLDIERS WERE ON BOARD. THAT MILITARY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER. THIS IS A FULL OUT SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION. IT IS DANGEROUS. AND ACCORDING TO CHIEF JOHN DONNELLY WITH WASHINGTON FIRE AND EMS, IT IS ALSO VERY CHALLENGING. THE CHALLENGES ARE ACCESS THE WATER THAT WE’RE OPERATING IN IS ABOUT EIGHT FEET DEEP. THERE IS WIND, THERE IS PIECES OF ICE OUT THERE. SO IT’S JUST DANGEROUS AND HARD TO WORK IN. AND BECAUSE THERE’S NOT A LOT OF LIGHTS, YOU’RE OUT THERE SEARCHING EVERY SQUARE INCH OF SPACE TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYBODY. THE DIVERS ARE DOING THE SAME THING IN THE WATER. THE WATER IS DARK. IT IS MURKY. AND THAT IS A VERY TOUGH CONDITION FOR THEM TO DIVE IN. AND OF COURSE, THE CONCERN IS THE WATER IS ALSO VERY COLD, ABOUT 35 DEGREES NOW. MARYLAND STATE POLICE HAS SENT THEIR UNDERWATER RECOVERY TEAM TO ASSIST THE METROPOLITAN POLICE. AND ACCORDING TO GOVERNOR MOORE, WHO POSTED OVERNIGHT ON X, HE SAYS THAT THE MARYLAND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OPERATION HAS GONE AHEAD AND ENHANCED THEIR STATUS AT THEIR OPERATIONS CENTER. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT DNR POLICE ARE ON THE SCENE AS WELL. WE’VE HEARD EARLIER FROM SEAN STREICHER WHO IS OUT AT BWI. THERE’S NO OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS THERE BECAUSE AT REAGAN NATIONAL, THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED UNTIL AT LEAST 11:00 THIS MORNING. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING THIS IS A FLUID SITUATION, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY BE EXTENDED IF NECESSARY. I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE, IF YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN IN THIS AREA, THIS IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT BY ANY MEANS. YOU CANNOT GET CLOSE TO THE SCENE AND YOU CANNOT GET ACCESS TO REAGAN NATIONAL AT ALL. THEY HAVE EVERYWHERE BLOCKED OFF AT THIS MOMENT. SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. YOU SEE THOSE BRIGHT FLASHING LIGHTS ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER THERE, AS THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO BE VERY, VERY HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL PULL A SURVIVOR FROM THE RIVER. THAT IS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT. THAT IS BECAUSE BACK IN 1982, FLIGHT 90 CRASHED INTO THE 14TH STREET BRIDGE AND WENT RIGHT INTO THE WATER. IT WAS AN AIR FLORIDA FLIGHT BOUND FOR FLORIDA. IT WAS LEAVING THEN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT BEFORE IT WAS RENAMED REAGAN, AND IT WAS A HORRIBLE SITUATION THERE. IT WAS IN JANUARY AS WELL. THAT FLIGHT, THOUGH, WENT INTO THE WATER AT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON. 79 PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD, 75 PASSENGERS AND FOUR CREW MEMBERS, AND THERE WERE FIVE SURVIVORS. SO THAT IS WHY STILL AT THIS HOUR, THERE IS STILL SOME HOPE HERE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PULL SOMEONE ALIVE OUT OF THIS WATER. SO STILL A SEARCH AND RESCUE, ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATELY, UPWARDS OF 19 BODIES HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. REPORT\n",

      "We continue to follow breaking news outside of Washington DC where an American airline plane collided with a Black Hawk helicopter. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is holding a press conference right now with the very latest. Let's listen in. Good morning. I'm Muriel Bowser. I'm the mayor of Washington DC. We are here at Reagan National Airport, uh, to provide an update on the tragic events of last night. I'm joined by US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, DC Fire and EMF's Chief, uh, John, John Donnelly, uh, American Airlines CEO Robert Eisen. The MY the Washington Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority CEO Jack Carter, United States Senator Mark Warner, United States Senator Tim Kaine, US Representative, uh, Don Beyer, as well as the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Pamela Smith, uh, and we are joined by first responders from across the metropolitan Washington region. I speak for all of us when I say and certainly all Washingtonians, how uh very sad we are uh for American Airlines, for the United States Department of Defense, and for all Americans for the loss of life um that happened with the collision of these aircrafts. We know that includes families from across our region as well as in Kansas and across the country. Uh, this morning, we all share in a profound sense of grief. I do want to thank the first responders who acted quickly last night, who ran towards danger, went into a very frigid river and have worked throughout the night. Uh, Chief Donnelly reported in last night, last night's briefing that we have a strong mutual aid agreement in our region, and those teams have worked together throughout the night in really tough and heartbreaking conditions, and we should all thank them for their heroic efforts. So we'll have several updates today. I'm first gonna um turn to the Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, and uh then you will hear directly from Chief John Donnelly with a situational update. Thank you Mayor. Again, Sean Duffy here, uh Secretary of Transportation, uh, we wish we were gathering for different purposes today. I just want to let you know that the Department of Transportation, the FAA, along with the White House, President Trump, local, state. And federal partners all working together on this incident in unison. I couldn't be prouder of this team that's been assembled, working tirelessly. Mayor, I want to thank you specifically for your work. Uh, a few details I'd like to give all of you, uh, and, and some of you reported this, but last night if you live in the DC area, you would know that this was a clear night last night. The helicopter was in a standard pattern. If you live in the DC area, you'll see helicopters up and down the river. This flight pattern is seen oftentimes when you live in DC. This was a standard flight pattern last night as well. The American Airline flight coming in to land was in a standard flight pattern as it was coming into DCA. So this was not unusual with a military aircraft flying the river and aircraft landing at DCA. And again, if you live in the area, you'll see that frequently with those two aircraft working together. As many of you reported, we have located the two aircrafts. The fuselage of the American Airline plane was inverted. It's been located in 3 different sections. It's about waist deep water, so that recovery is going to go on today as that recovery takes place of the fuselage of the aircraft. NTSB is going to start to analyze that aircraft, partner with the FAA with all of the information we have to get the best results possible for the American people. I would just say that. Safety is our expectation. Everyone who flies in American skies expects that we fly safely, that when you depart an airport, you get to your destination. That didn't happen last night, and I know that President Trump, his administration, the FAA, the DOT, we will not rest until we have answers for the families and for the flying public. You should be assured that when you fly, you're safe. Thank you. Is that yours. Thank you, Secretary. Thank you, Mayor. I'm joined today by with uh Fire Chief Bonnett from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, um, and I'm John Donnelly, Chief of the District of Columbia Fire and EMS department. Last night at 8:48, the control tower sounded an alert which uh alerts responders to respond to a report of an aircraft crash on or near the airport. That sets off an immediate response from the airport authority fire department, from the District of Columbia and Metropolitan Harbor Patrol fireboats and other fire boats on the river in order to support that type of operation. Uh, very quickly this call escalated. It became apparent, you know, the responders realized that they had a plane crash, um, and immediately escalated to a response that ultimately included about 300 people last night. Uh, these responders found extremely frigid conditions. They found heavy wind, they found ice on the water, and they're operated all night in those conditions. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the agencies that responded in addition to DC Fire and EMS and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Montgomery County Fire Department, the Prince George's County Fire Department, the Charles County Fire Department, the Baltimore County Police Department, the An Arundel County Fire Department. The Alexandria Fire Department, the Arlington County Fire Department, the Fairfax Fire Department, the Prince William Fire Department, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Maryland State Police, the Maryland Natural Resources Police, the Department of Defense, the Joint Base in um Bowling, fire department, and uh the staff there, the US Army, the US Coast Guard, the United States Park Police, the Metropolitan Police Department, the FBI and the NTSB. Um, despite all those efforts, we are now at a point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation. Um. At this point we don't believe there are any survivors from this accident. And we have recovered 27 people from the plane and 1 from the helicopter. Uh, the district office of the medical examiner has lead on reuniting these bodies and these people with their loved ones, and we will continue to work to find all the bodies and collect them and reunite them with their loved ones. We should also acknowledge that the Virginia medical examiner and the Army medical examiner are involved in this operation and a very important part of getting people identified, so. Our hearts are certainly with um all of the crew uh in American Airlines and we'll hear from CEO ISO. Thank you, Mayor. Uh, good morning. I'm Robert I I'm the CEO of American Airlines. I want to express my sincere condolences for the accident that happened at DCA last night. We're absolutely heartbroken for the family and loved ones, the passengers and crew members. And also for those that were on the military aircraft. Our focus right now is doing everything that we can to support all of those involved and also the PSA Airlines team. This is devastating. We are all hurting incredibly. We urge any family and friends looking for information about their loved ones to call our designated helpline. And that's a 1-800-679. 8215 1800-679. 8215. And here's what I can share at this early stage. American Eagle flight 5342 operated by PSA Airlines traveling from Wichita, Kansas to Reagan National Airport, was involved in an accident just before 9 p.m. local time on final approach into Reagan National. It collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach. And at this time we don't know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft. Flight 5342, a CRJ 700 was under the command of four crew members. They carried 60 passengers, as you know, for a total of 64 people on board. In addition to local resources already here in DC, American Airlines has activated our care team, and that's a group of specialists that are trained to support these types of responses. These team members are on site are arriving soon. And additionally, we have members of our GO team that are on the ground here in DC and they're being deployed with resources to do everything that we can to take care of the needs of the families and the loved ones. Of the passengers and crew members, and that is our sole focus. And we're so grateful for the first responders. They've been working through the night with courageous efforts. We're actively working with local, state, and federal authorities on emergency response efforts and closely coordinating with PSA airlines as they cooperate fully with the NTSB on the investigation. I know that there are many questions at this early stage. I just won't be able to answer many, but we'll provide additional information as it comes. Thank you. I want to introduce the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority CEO Jack Potter. The authority manages uh Washington Reagan Washington National and Dulles International. Good morning and thank you Mayor. First, let me begin by expressing our condolences for all the victims of this flight and for their families. There's a lot of grieving going on and so we're very sympathetic to that. I want to echo what was said about the first responders. When there's a problem in this area, everybody drops everything and they rush to where the problem is. So I want to thank the chief, the entire team from Washington DC, but just as important, the list of folks that the chief described, federal authorities have been here in mass, and so a lot of effort was brought to bear. Unfortunately we weren't able to rescue anyone. Uh, but we are in the recovery mode right now, uh, and I just want to, uh, you know, last night I expressed the fact that we hope to open at 11 o'clock today and that is still the case. We're going to open the airport at 11 o'clock and again, uh, condolences to the families uh and uh thanks to the many, many who are still out there working very, very hard to complete this recovery. Thank you, Mayor. Um, I do want to acknowledge that, um, the Virginia Transportation Secretary is here, uh, in addition to the Alexandria mayor, uh, and I will, um, like to ask, uh, members of the Virginia, um, congressional delegation, uh, to the podium next, US Senator, uh, Mark Warner, uh, followed by Tim Kaine and Representative Don Beyer. Um, thank you, Mayor. Uh, I want to join with everyone else and express my condolences for the victims. For folks who don't live in the DMV. We are made up of a lot of jurisdictions Reagan Airports in Virginia. Across the river we have Maryland, obviously the district. But has been indicated by the chief when tragedy happens. All those distinctions between the various jurisdictions and our federal partners all disappear, and I want to again thank all the first responders. On a personal note, I'll just add that Literally, I, I now know I was coming back from the district. From a dinner to my home in old town Alexandria. And while I did not see the collision, Um, I wondered I've never seen this many. Red lights streaming towards the airport and across the river in Maryland about this time. Um my phone started blowing up and I realized that this accident had taken place. There'll be a time to figure out I know NTSB will have a briefing later in the day, but to the victims, our condolences to the first responders, our thanks. Um, the sorrow, thanks and questions. So sorrow, as all have expressed to the crew, to the passengers, to the soldiers, to their families, to their friends, to their loved ones, to people who are still trying to get information and unsure whether their loved ones have been lost. We offer our profound condolences to them and our sorrow for this tragedy. Thanks, I'll echo, Mayor, what you began with. When you see a challenge like this and you see people from so many different agencies, local, state, federal with different uniforms, different badges, but working in such a coordinated way even in the midst of a tragedy, it does give you a sense of appreciation and pride in people's willingness to. Come to the danger and work together and I started to see that as a local official 30 years ago in Richmond and definitely have seen it here and then finally questions they're gonna be a lot of questions obviously a lot of questions and that's what the NTSB's job is is to be an independent investigator of incidents like this and they are here we were in dialogue with them earlier today. They've been here since they got the alert and they will be doing the work and playing lead in. Answering the many questions that we have and that's as it should be, it's not a time to speculate it's a time to investigate and get answers to the questions we need and I have confidence that will be done. Thank you. Following up on the senator, I think grief, thanks, and service. With millions and millions of Americans traveling every year, we are all grieving, knowing that it could have been our loved ones, it could have been us, and our hearts go out to all those who have lost folks in the most partisan place also, it's, I'm really thankful that Democrats and Republicans, people from all over have come together to try to make sure that the people are served. As a local representative, I want the families to know that our office. is available to serve you in any way we possibly can through this time of grief and transition and loss. And then also just note that we're deeply grateful for the people who risked their lives last night on a moment's notice and spent the whole night on the river and the ice and the wind serving us and then finally, as Senator Warner noted, after the NTSB investigation, we've got to make sure that at the federal level and with the support of Virginia and Maryland, DC, we're doing everything we can to make sure this does not happen again. So, um, with that, it, it's been said already that the National Transportation Safety Board, um, becomes the lead agency in the investigation, um, our jurisdiction and, and DC where the crash occurred. Um, over the river is, um, concludes, uh, as we, uh, in, in the leadership role of the unified command as we shift to a recovery effort, uh, we expect the National Transportation Safety Board, um, to provide briefings to the press\n",

      "an American Airlines flight has collided midair with a helicopter a military helicopter in Washington DC the US Federal Aviation Administration said it happened whilst on approach to Runway 33 at Reagan Washington National Airport at around 900 p.m. local time the jet we understand was carrying 60 passengers and four crew whilst three US Army soldiers were on board the Black Hawk military helicopter president Donald Trump says that he's been briefed on what he has described as the terrible accident and went on to thank emergency responders for their incredible work police divers and boats have been searching the water now for a number of hours looking for survivors whilst the US Federal authorities have begun their investigation okay let's cross to our correspondent Live From The Scene maril Thomas Marilyn you're there Merlin you're there first off um just take us through the timeline of what happened so what we know is that a commercial airline the American Airlines collided midair with an army Blackhawk helicopter and as you said there were 60 passengers on board the commercial airline as well as four crew members and there were also three soldiers on board the helicopter as well and just in the last few minutes as well we've seen reports that at least 18 bodies were recovered uh from the river that's according to our official Partners CBS but just to say there are there is no official update on the number of casualties as of yet and this is still a developing story but that Collision occurred here uh at around 9900 p.m. local time uh and it happened midair and it um it happened as the commercial airline was on its approach to Runway 33 and the scene that you can see behind me is the airport itself so you can see the the blue and red Sirens behind me and the Blackness to my left and that is the river as you can see here and there is a flurry of activity as the emergency operation is underway we know that there are uh emergency divers and police boats and emergency rescue operations very much underway but just to remind you it's midnight here local time and so it's extremely cold and it's dark and that will make that uh rescue operation all that much harder uh and you know we're constantly seeing more and more official um police cars and emergency responders arriving at this airport uh and we are expecting to hear a press conference in about half an hour and we'll expect more updates regularly throughout the night as well okay Merlin let's just uh go back to the the crash itself um I understand that there has been some audio that's been released um from Air Traffic Control um we are waiting for for more information on that but what have eyewitnesses described in the minutes leading up to that crash we've spoken to people here at the scene um and they didn't want to be named but one did tell me that they actually witnessed the moment of the Collision itself so they saw the fireball uh of the Collision itself and it was a bright orange in the sky and then it fell uh down into what this person uh thought was the river and he heard a loud uh boom sound as the Collision happened um and he described to me how scared and terrified he was um that he wanted to fall to his knees just watching um the moment happen before him couldn't quite believe his eyes um and so there's very much a lot of confusion here and people have been arriving at the airport um trying to find out what's happening um some people who have arrived expecting their their loved ones to arrive on other flights which have now been um re rooted to other airports all flights have been ground um to a halt here there are no flights taking off or Landing here um at all in the next few hours at least um that we know of um but we'll expect to hear more updates as we go through the night um more regularly okay so let me just reiterate what Merlin has told us there is a ground stop it's referred to as a ground stop this is a traffic management initiative which means that aircraft that meet specific criteria criteria need to remain on their on the ground at their origin origination Airport so there is a ground stop in place at Reagan National Airport no flights coming in no flights coming out Merlin there are two helicopters that are operating in the area and this is part of the search and uh rescue that is taking place at the moment what exactly are those helicopters doing what can you see them doing they have I'm I presume very bright spotlights on board what have you seen [Music] yeah I can hear them weing above me now you can hear that sound um and they are just monitoring the situation and we know that there are lots and lots of emergency responders on site dozens of fire trucks and and police um attending to the scene as well as U divers which have been sent from uh neighboring states like Maryland as well uh which H which are part of the rescue operation and we also know that the US Coast Guard is also involved in this operation as well and this will be a massive operation um and it will will be made all the more difficult by the fact that it is extremely cold here the temperature is cold even in the air and so it'll be even um colder in the water as well where this rescue operation is ongoing as we speak yeah I mean it it's it's only a matter of it's what a week just over a week that we had the inauguration of Donald Trump and because of that truly frigid weather it was moved indoors what are the conditions like along the river itself at the moment was it was it frozen over the pomac river Upstream it is it is frozen in Parts here it's hard to see because it's so dark it's it's just past midnight it's very dark here um and as I say it is very cold and so those rescue divers and this police will be operating in very frigid cold conditions and as you said uh you know we've had a spell of that here in DC and that is exactly what um prompted the inauguration to be moved indoors and so you know the city is just recovering from that and so there will be some of the river will still be frozen over we've seen elsewhere some of the tidal Bas in other bodies of water in the city here are still frozen over and you know just it was just a few days ago that there was still snow and ice um on these streets as well so the temperatures are very cold and the conditions are very difficult\n",

      "a massive search and rescue operation is underway in Washington DC in The Frigid Waters of the pomac river just hours ago a commuter Jet and an army blackhaw helicopter on a training flight collided in midair at least 64 people were aboard the plane and three soldiers were on board the helicopter several bodies have been pulled from the water and so far no survivors have been rescued joining me now is ABC's Alex Bret in Washington DC Alex what can you tell us hey so first let me Orient you a little bit we are on the departures ramp in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 and you can see this massive scene behind me that sea of red lights from all those first responder vehicles and then up there in the distance that is a search helicopter it has been doing laps performing a grid search here trying to look for any possible survivors of this crash and and that's because time is of the encep and uh right now as we're getting further and further into the night the temperature has dipped now below 40° about 38 last checked and so for any potential survivors that are in the the Bic behind me time is of the essence and because of that we have seen a massive response I'm talking about dozens of fire trucks uh dozens of cop cars from different municipalities and different agencies and also those uh search and rescue boats and dive teams now all making their way over there trying trying to find any other possible survivors thank you Alex I'm joined Now by ABC News contributor and Aviation consultant Steve ganard Steve thank you for joining us tonight you're a former military pilot how does something like this happen at one of the busiest airports in the country yeah uh Byron whenever the NTSB does uh investigations into mishaps like this they gather lots and lots of in uh uh evidence they aren't ready to say what caused this but these days there's so much data that we get immediately that we can begin to draw some immediate conclusion so we do know because we have the tower tapes that there was an Army helicopter that was flying south down the pomac as this Regional Jet was landing at just on Runway 33 which means it was just heading towards the Northwest so if you've been to DC sort of pointing at um at the Kennedy Center and so the helicopter is allowed to fly along the patomic as long as it stays at 200 ft the tower said to the hel opter do you see the Regional Jet in front of you the helicopter acknowledged we see it and we will avoid it now what I think may have happened is that that helicopter crew misidentified the Regional Jet that they eventually hit they may have seen another helicopter at night you have lots of Lights Out There the city of Alexandria the city of Washington and so they may have gotten drawn off on what was not their traffic and they thought that they were clear but unfortunately they weren't and the midair Collision occurred we're talking about a commercial jetliner and a military Blackhawk helicopter why again would a military aircraft especially a military chapter be so close to a commercial jetliner the helicopters are flying up and down the pic all day long and all night long because of all of the things that go on in Washington DC that require helicopters particularly in an emergency situation so in this case everybody seems to have done everything right the helicopter was where it was supposed to be below 200 ft they were talking to the tower the tower said do you see this the Regional Jet was on what we call short final so maybe under 200 fet the crew in the Regional Jet are looking at the runway and they're thinking about finding where their touchdown point is the helicopter is crossing right to left it's in their peripheral vision and they just don't see it and it wouldn't uh set off any alarm in in the uh in the Regional Jet not necessarily uh but and and everybody was talking to everybody and everybody should have been where they were and so the problem here was is that it seemed to be a misidentification by the helicopter crew when they thought they had the Regional Jet but they probably saw some other aircraft and they were thinking that they were okay when they really weren't we're in the early hours this case there's a a recovery Rescue Mission going on right now people are are are risking their lives in hopes of saving lives Survivor we don't know about that at this point but walk us through what the investigation likely looks like right now what are people looking to do what are the priorities right now right now Byron it's try to find somebody who may still be alive in the in the in the river um airports that are next to water have uh have crash fire rescue both for on the land and in uh in in the water so San Francisco LaGuardia at at Reagan so they had crash boats out there crash fire rescue boats out there immediately they had divers ready to jump in the water so right now everything focuses on doing the best to find anybody that might still be alive once that is no longer the task then it becomes the the task of the NTSB to figure out why did this happen St a final question if I may uh we are understand it was a moon moonless night in DC as dark as it could be so what the pilots have been relying on what they could see around them what they've been relying primarily on their instruments it would have been visual cuz it's a nice night here uh in Washington DC Byron and and they probably were on night vision goggles now I can tell you having spent time on night vision goggles over water it is really uncomfortable you think helicopters when you see them fly down the patomic before they're you know at 100 feet or less they like to fly low it's fine fun to fly low in a helicopter but in this case when you're flying over water at night you can't tell the sky from the water it's it's uh it's vertigo induced in and it's very uncomfortable so I would imagine that they were stepped up at that 200t level just because it was more comfortable and they could look outside and look at the Horizon more and and try to a avoid any kind of a spatial disorientation so that's probably why they were at an altitude where the Regional Jet was coming in in on short final so lots of things went wrong it was it was four or five things that could have been broken this this chain of advents could have been broken at any point and tragically it wasn't thank you Steve earlier tonight American Airlines CEO Robert Isam making a statement we are actively working with local state and federal authorities on Emergency Response efforts and the American Airlines care team has been activated to assist our passengers and their families we're cooperating fully with the national Transportation safety board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can our cooperation is without pause and we want to learn everything we can about today's events that work will take time but anything we can do now we're doing this crash is a terrible disaster in the first major commercial jet crash in the US in more than 15 years tonight tragedy at Washington's DC Reagan's National Airport American Eagle flight 5342 from witto Kansas coming in for landing colliding with the US Army Blackhawk helicopter this live stream from the keny center's Earth cam webcam showing the explosion in the air the plane carrying 60 passengers and four crew the Blackhawk confirmed to have three army soldiers on board tonight the US figure skating team confirming that several members were on board did you see that you saw that air Del 32 sorry um I don't know if you caught earlier what happened but um there was a collision on the approaching the 33 uh we're going to be shutting down operations for the uh indefinite future if you want to go back to the gates High gu you guys coordinate with company let me know what you want to do all right we're let the company uh talking to them right now yeah we uh we witnessed the whole thing authorities addressing the incident at a late night press conference at 8:48 um an alert was sounded initiating a reg uh a large regional response at uh 8:58 the first units arrived on the scene and found an aircraft in the water and began rescue operations emergency crews rushing to the scene diers in the pomac searching for any survivors they are working diligently and very dark in cold conditions cold water uh to execute this rescue operation so it's a highly complex operation the conditions out there are extremely rough they're dealing with uh relatively U windy conditions wind is hard uh out on the river haunting images emerging tonight showing the debris as rescue crews search for survivors Ari shman lives close to Reagan Airport report in Alexandria Virginia so I just saw the plane and I knew something was wrong because it was very very close to the ground it was maybe 80 or 100 feet above the ground banked all the way to the right um I saw that for all of you know this was maybe two seconds that I was looking at it I looked back at the road I looked back again and it was gone I didn't see any crash into the ground I didn't see a fireball or an explosion or Flames another eyewitness recounting what they saw but when we went to the roof it was Insanity police trucks ambulances um command Vehicles Ranken National Airport was immediately shut down with no flights coming or going an army official confirming the army uh60 helicopter originated out of Fort belor Virginia the airport director in witcha Kansas addressing the media I don't have the exact time of when the incident occurred but we were notified um fairly shortly thereafter it just breaks our heart to hear something like this occur and so it's it's devastating for everyone Kansas Senator Jerry Moran describing flying the very route the plane took himself many times I lobbied American Airlines to begin having a a direct non-stop flight service to DCA that flight has been in existence about a year we're going to know people who are on this flight know their family members know somebody so this is a very personal circumstance this is the first major commercial crash in the US since the kogan air Buffalo crash in 2009 there have been other incidents like the Asiana Runway crash in 2013 where two people died the last fatality on the plane was the woman who was partially sucked out of a Southwest window in 2018 this has been the safest period for aviation in history this crash will undoubtedly shake the industry it's reminiscent of another tragic airline crash January 1982 in air Florida flight crashed into the pomac river 74 people on board were killed five survived rescued from the icy waters the scope of tonight's Collision still unfolding you know when one person dies it's a tragedy but when many many many people die it's an unbearable sorrow it's a heartbreak beyond measure joining me now is ABC Chief Global Affairs correspondent Martha Ritz on Dangerfield Island Byron we are r right on the banks of the pomac river the midair would have occurred just behind where we are you can see all the rescue and Recovery Vehicles they have been out there for hours this is also exactly the approach that Regional Jet would have made along very calm Waters very dark Waters tonight approaching Washington DC you could have seen as I can now the Washington Monument the US capital A City full of Lights we've also heard helicop opter all night and watched them Circle this area looking for any possible survivors any possible rescue sometimes there were three up there at a time all had their lights on uh it is a very Grim night here on the banks of the pomac Byron our thanks to Martha joining me now is greater DC resident Jamie Lynn who witnessed from her own home some of the Frantic search and rescue efforts by First Responders Jamie Lynn thank you so much for joining us you live near Reagan Airport what is it like there right now so right now it is still a very active scene um still hearing just as much if not more noise from emergency response specifically now I've heard uh quite an uptick in the number of aircraft over the area so just assuming that there's more helicopters assisting in um those search and rescue efforts now I know you said you didn't hear or see the actual Collision but when did you realized something was wrong it was it was a normal Wednesday and I went to our local um Arling Arlington Community Facebook group where our neighbors will often post news and I saw that the most recent post was an a crash and I rubbed my eyes thinking like here I look out my window because we have a direct line of sight to the airport we're just a couple hundred yards away and you just see this intense cluster of emergency response and that's when the feeling kind of hit that something really horrible it happened I understand it's a moonless night over DC so it's darker than dark there this evening could in your wildest imagination could you have imagined in this post 911 world with so much focus on Aviation Security that this kind of thing would have happened in the nation's capital that's what I you know was have been saying to my family and friends is that when you live here in in Washington DC in the immediate surrounding cities you kind of feel immune to to being um someone that this could happen to or see this happen we have one of the most Reg ulated um and and looked after air zones in the world we have all eyes on the ground and in the air 247 and so to just kind of feel like that that cloak of safety has been ripped away you you literally cannot fathom\n",

      "want to show our viewers what happened in the seconds before the Collision please uh be aware that this is the moment before impact at the aircraft the Bombadier had changed its direction to a different Runway you can see the helicopter to the left Bombadier to the right moments later a large explosion both aircraft are now upside down in the pomac we just received audio from uh traffic

you go to Baltimore 19 aircraft were um asked to land at different airports just after 9:00 at local time last night this is the com conversation were told uh happened between those two aircraft a few minutes before landing traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilot said that they were able to do that uh controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33 flight tracking SES showed the plane adjust its approach to the new Runway less than 30 seconds before the crash an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the the arriving plane in sight The Controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later p25 passed behind the crj seconds later after that the two aircraft collided uh David uh we are getting the impression from the Kansas Senator uh that All Souls have been lost on both aircraft yes K I think the words of um Senator Marshall from Kansas will be the words we remember for a very long time from that press conference he said when one person dies it's a tragedy but when many die it's an unbearable sorrow he went on to say he wished there was much more they could do it's really hard when you lose probably over 60 canons at once it's a tragedy that we've lost them until that point the only suggestion of fatalities had come from the US News Network CBS reporting that 18 bodies had been recovered from the body from the from the river but it would appear that uh there may be no survivors and that would make this the most tragic air disaster over the US capital in more than 40 uh years we've been processing a lot of information coming to us in the last couple of hours I think the most critical bit has come from the fire chief and the mayor updating us at that press conference confirming that it was 8:48 when the alert was sounded about an incident involving a commercial aircraft and a helicopter the fire chief said just 10 minutes later at 858 the first units arrived on the scene and began rescue operations about 300 responders working as we speak boats and divers working as part of a rescue operation in extremely rough conditions it's very cold and windy in Washington the temperature is expected to drop further during the night it's just gone halfast 1 in the morning here and he says it's an active operation that will go on for many hours so I suppose we've got three things happening uh maybe four things happening at the same time we have a uh search and rescue operation ongoing there were 60 passengers uh on the American Airlines flight four crew and there were three uh military personnel on the US Army helicopter all it would seem unaccounted for at this moment of time uh in addition to that there is clearly um a recovery operation to some extent underway now to if what we are hearing from the senators from Kansas is correct we also know that the Federal Aviation uh Authority and the National Aviation safety board have already arrived at the seene and commenced their investigation they will be Desperately Seeking to retrieve the Black Box uh recording from those aircraft the plane we understand is divided in two upside down in the water the helicopter the Blackhawk helicopter also upside down in the water so it's a very complex scene so uh we have a recovery operation in addition to a rescue operation we have an air investigation underway and we have the political response as well uh the president himself being briefed uh around the clock now uh in the situation room where he is expressing real concern about how this was able to happen how this helicopter found itself in the flight path is so close to um Reagan National Airport the vice president JD Vance also saying that he's monitoring the situation and praying for all of those who were on board and their loved ones and I think that perhaps is uh the greatest part of this tragedy that they were on approach to the short Runway 33 at Reagan National coming to the end of their flight from witcha Kansas and would have had people waiting for them already uh at that airport and those people of course are now dealing with the fact that their friends and loved ones may not be coming home\n",

      "for. Good reason. Meantime, we'll get back to the Comcast news and go through some of that. But we do have this developing story that we do have to bring you this morning. And we say it with great sympathy, because there is a great tragedy that took place in the skies just outside of Washington, DC last night. A military military helicopter colliding with an American Airlines jet near Reagan National Airport this morning. The search and rescue operations continue in the icy Potomac River, where both aircrafts plunged after that crash. So far, no survivors have been located. At least 67 people on boards of both of those aircrafts, collectively, some members of the U.S. Figure skating team are believed to be among the victims. And we are all praying for a miracle at this point. Eamon is at the scene on the Potomac River. Eamon, walk us through what happened and where things stand right now. >> Andrew. The first emergency call was 8:48 p.m. Last night. Investigators were on the scene. Search and rescue on the scene ten minutes after that. We're now getting daylight here, just on the scene, getting our first live look in the daylight of. >> The. >> Crash scene. I can tell you that park police helicopters are now circling overhead. They seem to be orbiting that site on the far side of the Potomac River, across from where we are standing in Alexandria, Virginia. That will be the D.C. Side of the river, where search and rescue efforts are focused right now. Tragedy deepening this morning, as our NBC. Affiliate here in Washington, D.C, is reporting multiple sources to them saying that officials have recovered more than 30 bodies from the site of the wreckage here. >> So the death. >> Toll here is tragic and expected to get worse as the hours continue. Because we are now more than nine hours after this incident and no reports of any. Survivors have come in so far. And I can tell you also that the conditions on this river. The river is deep today. It is flowing quickly today and it is very cold. We know that this is the highest level the water has been at for days. The water is moving at its fastest rate since Tuesday last week. The water temperature just at 32ºF. Very very cold. This river was iced over entirely last week, to the point where you could almost walk across the Potomac River, something we rarely see here in Washington, D.C. So that gives you a sense of the conditions that crews have been working in throughout the night, as they try to hope against hope in terms of finding somebody alive in that wreckage. I can also tell you, Andrew, there is sort of an eerie silence here in this area. We are just to the south of Ronald Reagan National Airport, which is just to my right. Your left here. And typically this area every couple of minutes is awash in sound from aircraft, aircraft landing, taking off at National airport. It is very loud here. Normally today all we hear are those helicopters circling the area looking for any survivors, any bodies. So this is a very difficult scene. They say they expect ultimately, Reagan National Airport will be closed until 11 a.m. This morning. No flights in or out until that hour. And we are expecting at the bottom of this hour, 7:30 a.m. Eastern. We are expecting an additional briefin\n",

      "deep seek is a Chinese AI company and it is shattering the model of American capitalism even as I speak the whole of the American economy is now wedded to Big Tech without big tech there would be very little growth in the US economy without big tech there would be almost no growth at all in US Stock markets with big tech there is both and the myth that the American economy is in good shape is largely based upon the idea that the stock market is at record highs and that's all down to the value of the hype around AI artificial intelligence in other words and yet what we've seen is that a newcomer into the market called Deep seek a Chinese company developed with a tiny amount of money has produced a model of AI that appears to be better than that has being put forward by chat GPT which is the leading model of AI available from US tech companies to people around the world at present deep seek seems to be able to answer questions as well as chat GPT and as well as Microsoft's version of AI and the other various sources that you can find on the web it's done it in the most extraordinary way it has not used the high-tech chips that have been produced by the American company NVIDIA it has not used nearly as much energy to produce its answers as it appears is required to power those Nvidia chips and it has produced it on the basis of large language models which are much cheaper to generate and produce than those which are being put into place by the likes of open AI who are the owners of chat GPT there is something profoundly disruptive about what deep seek is doing as a result this literally shatters American capitalism at its very core let me explain why American capitalism is based upon three fundamental ideas the first is that whatever it invents must be protected from all forms of competition to the greatest degree possible so that the wealth generated by any invention is concentrated in the hands of the fewest possible number of people to benefit them most of all you can see the model it has produced the tech Bros as they are called the massively wealthy people who own the largest tech companies in the USA it has also of course given returns to those people who they have let invest in their companies but that wealth is still concentrated amongst a tiny proportion of people in the US these companies are all about the concentration of power in the hands of a few in the USA they've achieved this through the second characteristic of us capitalism which is to be as anticompetitive as it is possible to be the most important person in many US companies is not an engineer or a salesperson or an inventor no it's the patent lawyer the person who is employed to put in the path of potential competitors the maximum number of impediments that the law can provide to ensure that they cannot copy any element of the business model of the company and therefore pose effective challenge to it these lawyers who protect patents and copyrights to ensure that rents can be charged to the consumers of these companies way in excess of the real value of the products that the company makes because it isn't exposed to proper competition are the fundamental basis on which American capitalism is now built it is the deeply anti-competitive this then leads to the third characteristic of us capitalism at present which is it is grossly inefficient if you can protect yourself from competition to make vast amounts of money for a few people and to extract extortionate value from consumers you have no incentive to minimize your costs because why would you need to do so you have money coming literally out of your ear holes and therefore you you might as well spend it you might as well have that comfort zone of having large numbers of people work for you even if they aren't really required you'll still declare an enormous profit you will feel like the king of the castle you will see the rewards that those grateful employees send your away and you will feel good about it if you are the boss of one of these companies there is no incentive to be lean mean and efficient as a consequence and that is supposedly what market capitalism should deliver but in the case of the USA absolutely does not deep seek has shattered all those myths not only has it been put together very cheaply but it has adopted a totally different approach to the market it has actually made its source software open source in other words anybody can access it and use it this is the absolute opposite of the American model in instead of putting legal impediments around somebody who wants to use their software deepseeker said have it use it it will still be charging for access to the big language model that it owns and the big answers that people will ask of it but it's going to do so at a much lower price than us companies are doing for similar inquiries and it can of course afford to do so because it's using much less energy on Lower Tech this virtually shatters the whole investment strategy that has dominated the thinking in the runup to Trump's election that has been built around the idea that billions hundreds of billions will be invested in Ai and that will generate the growth which will keep Trump in office well suppose it won't now of course one has to have a sneaking suspicion that this might Al be very carefully timed by the Chinese government to destabilize Trump in the face of potential tariff Wars and I have that sneaking suspicion so I will put it on the table and say it's there but deep seek does however work I've seen models that have been produced by it and they are undoubtedly good in that case whether or not this is a strategy by the Chinese government deep seek is capable of disrupting serious parts of the US aai market and might even prevent the US getting the worldwide Monopoly of this type of activity which it's got in the case of Microsoft and Google and Twitter and so on those monopolistic Trends may not be capable of reproduction in AI if deep seek and its own Chinese competitors can produce something very different to that which open AI Microsoft Google and others were promising at enormous expense I have no idea where this is going I genuinely cannot predict and I don't think anybody else can and this might of course Al so all be a storm in a teacup that is a possibility but let's presume it isn't let's presume this is real if it is the whole basis on which the Trump appeal to the US market was built is undermined but something even deeper than that is true if American economic power which is based around Ai and its potential is shattered Trump's ability to create an isolationist USA backed up by Tarth barriers is also removed deep seek is something much more significant than being an AI model whether or not it is good in that role deep seek is challenging us capitalism to its very core and it's challenging the philosophy of the American right to its very core and whether or not the Chinese government time this to undermine those ideologies right now in the first week or so of Trump's Administration does not matter because it's doing it anyway and this could be very big\n",

      "the H thank you for watching thank you for joining us here in our Hollywood studio on um I appreciate that it was um oh we have so much to get through another weird day in Washington today where a man who does not believe in medical science May soon be in charge of Medical Science Robert Kennedy Jr Donald Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services faced the Senate today Bob and his brainworm answered questions for three and a half hours yesterday his cousin his first cousin Caroline Kennedy daughter of JFK made a video opposing his confirmation and adding to the long list of crazy stories about this crazy person his basement his garage his dorm room were always the center of the action where drugs were available and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed to his Hawks well that explains why he lost the job at John juice I guess it's he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed his Hawks and guess what not one of the 27 Senators on the finance committee asked him about it today not one we've reached the point where these cabinet picks are so nutty the idea that one of them was making steuart little smoothies doesn't even come up they did Grill him on the subject of abortion and vaccines subjects on which he is very conveniently evolved since pledging allegiance to the calop and chief most of his defense today was some version of I didn't say the modna vaccine turned kids gay I said it turned some of them bisexual the hearing was Rocky to say the least and not just because it sounds like he he swallowed a bag of rocks Kennedy was accompanied by his wife the actress Cheryl Hines who sat quietly behind her husband as he attempted to rewrite the story of his life did you say that exposure to pesticide causes children to become transgender no I never said that did you write in your book and I it's undeniable that African African AIDS is an entirely different disease from Western AIDS yes or no Mr Kennedy I'm not sure if I made that okay did you say Lyme disease is a highly likely militarily engineered bioweapon I probably did say that did you say that covid-19 targets black and white people but spared yeah yeah that's we got to get to the bottom of that and um and then there was Cheryl's TV husband from Curb Your Enthusiasm Bernie Sanders who not only did he have a line of questioning he brought visual aids you have started a group called The Children's Health defense you're the originator right now as I understand that on the their website they are selling what's called onesies these are little things clothing for babies one of them is titled unfa unafraid next one is no vax no problem are you supportive of this I had nothing to do with are you supportive of these onesies well that's a question I never thought I'd hear Bernie Sanders ask are you supportive of these onesies and what is your position on bigy RFK did not denounce the onesies and I have I bet they sold a bunch of them because of this hearing too they're $26 a piece which is that's not a lot of profit and it's also why I will be selling uh are you supportive of these onesies onesies for a limited time only all proceeds go to me it's unclear if RFK has the votes to move out of the finance committee and onto a vote by the Senate and full but it appears that at least one prominent Republican is bigly against him RFK Jr is a Democrat plant a radical left liberal I'd even take Biden over Junior because our country would last about a year or two longer than it would with Junior it would collapse almost immediately what's that oh that's something he said before he put him in charge of polio now he's terrific I have a theory I think Trump is secretly hoping the Senate doesn't approve RFK I think Trump thinks he's nuts but he promised them this job to get his Endor but if the Senate says no he'll be like oh well I tried on to Dr Oz barring that we could have a health and human services secretary who puts Easter animals in a blender paired up with a head of Homeland Security who shoots puppies and goats this is quite a farm Old McDonald has put together for us team Trump is already in a big self-made mess after the poorly conceived order to pause funding on all federal grants and Loans which caused all hell to break loose no there was a tremendous amount of confusion and backlash so much so they had to do an about face on it this afternoon but they are sticking with their plan of offering most full-time government employees a buyout if they voluntarily resign the Trump Administration is offering millions of federal workers buyouts if they quit by February 6th they will get full benefits and pay through September 30th and if there's anybody you can trust to honor a deal it's Donald J Trump it's he'll probably pay them in Melania meme coin or something but I think it's interesting could we make this offer to Trump too I mean let's get him a shopping cart give him 30 minutes to grab as much gold as he wants from Fort Knox let him spend the next four years playing golf with Kim Jong-un I'd be okay with that at his Thrice daily press conference today Trump detailed his administration's efforts to crack down on wasteful government spending we are merely looking at parts of the big bureaucracy where there has been tremendous waste and Fraud and Abuse in that process we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas condoms for Hamas they say it's the best way to keep the goats from getting pregnant over there it's we um we've identified and stop $50 million to buy condoms for Hamas I have to say whoever's writing his lies this time for him deserves a race they are hilarious money is a a big thing for Donald Trump after a long one week of work he spent some time playing golf on Monday at his Club in Miami and he always seemed to me to be the kind of guy who when he does leave a tip makes a whole show of it to let everyone know how generous he is you know what I mean okay take this and split it up among the guys you can give the guys less money who's going to take you want to take it Ta on [Applause] that he's he's holding the money like it's a condom for Hamas or something I wonder if ice has looked into the employees at any of the Trump Resorts yet I'm sure they'll get to that soon it fair is fair you know these deportation raids are happening around the country right now they're going just about as poorly as we expected they would many US citizens and even Native Americans have been erroneously hassled by Ice imagine asking a Native American are you here illegally they were like no you're here illegally you've been here illegally for 500 years questioning Native Americans to ask if they're illegal immigrants might be the trumpi thing Trump has ever trumped meanwhile in Canada they are super excited about becoming a part of the United States I'll tell you they're even acting like us now last week Alberta guy got in a fight outside a bar it was a very cold night it so cold in fact that his penis became Frozen to the sidewalk which is coincidentally how also how GMO and I met right remember that yeah yeah yeah TMZ broke this important story uh this was the headline Canadian bar this weenie is not getting roasted man's penis sticks to icy sidewalk the headline could use some the weenie is not getting roasted is it's not very we have a great story you need a a great headline like um freeze Willie this Pig needs a blanket TMZ did get footage of the incident fortunately he's going to get a frost it's quite a commotion the police laid him down on the ground and pick them up and finally I don't know what else they could do but they just yanked up off the ice that's the old Zam berer North they call it a Saskatoon circumcision it's good thing it doesn't snow that much in Florida or this would be a daily occurrence maybe they they should become our 51st state we might need someone to take our spot there is a movement of foot encouraging California to secede from the union it's a petition and if 500,000 people sign it it could make the ballot in 2028 they have until July to get the signatures ABS this I think this is a terrible idea how about we figure out how to get out of the Dodger Stadium parking lot first and then figure out how to get out of the country because if we become our own country who's going to turn on our giant water valve for us I mentioned last night Donald Trump's been taking Victory laps celebrating turning a non-existent valve or to turn our water back on Smoky unbearable was added again last night too again he wrote the water is Flowing big time in Northern California the long empty reservoirs will soon be full thank you president Trump thank you me for solving an imaginary problem I made up somehow he managed to fit six lies in three sentences there the water's flowing big time also is how he lets his nurse know it's time to change the diaper but unfortunately for Trump his dumb claim was shot down by none other than his favorite TV network a reporter from Fox News Jennifer Griffin posted us defense officials tell me they did not send troops to turn on the water in California despite president Trump's claims overnight well that's it Jennifer no cabinet position for you I guess no one seems to know why or how Trump came up with this silly idea but to put it to rest we've decided to go to the source and Governor Gavin Nome is joining us via satellite right now to answer the questions thanks for speaking thank you dein Governor Nome for uh joining us we appreciate it welcome to the rodeo brodeo thank you so listen I wanted to ask you about this claim Trump's making that he saved our state by turning on a giant water spigot no that's a big knob BR there's no big ass spigot okay um that's right but hey what is that behind you then oh that's not water that's the Intercontinental wheat grass pipeline I see when it comes to water mother n is in charge and we just go with the flow okay all right but now lowkey the fires are under control thanks to the Reigns that I summoned wait the Reigns you summoned well let me be clear it wasn't just me who summoned the rain I convened a multifaith tribunal of climate Shaman and medicine they thems and after an intense transcendental cleansing orgy we invoked a sick ass atmospheric River and boom Shakra lakra rain I see I see okay well that makes sense so where do the fires stand now well check it as you can see this map is inclusively colorcoded to indicate how much of a bummer the fires are mhm Palisades class five total bummer okay in Malibu it's a downer but not UNS surfable all right in Zuma Beach is going balls deep okay I think that that's good then I guess but what is the status of the Eden fire no idea what that is well that was that was a a big one it was the fire in Altadena oh yeah right yeah oh yeah well there's no surf in Altadena it's legit landlocked Okay but well we're not necessarily interested in the surf conditions in these places oh well then I'm happy to report that my Vineyard is fine okay I'm glad to hear that but as far as Trump goes oh oh oh speaking of do you see me lay one on Melania I did see this check check this out here I am with Donald dork yeah and then there's the wifey and know she likey she's down to pound okay oh I can hardly say I blame her governor and what about this these endangered fish Trump keeps bringing up the Delta smelt oh the Delta smelts yes these guys look at that one kind of reminds me of that Steven Miller but you know with like more friends yeah yeah bro they are soups endangered and we got to preserve those little at all costs okay cuz eggs from fishes are so delicious especially when paired with a glass of bone dry calip Pine oh that is so tight wait wait hold on a second wait who is this oh that's one of the shaman who helped me out with the rainfall wait that's a that's a kinam shaman from January 6th yeah yeah yeah but he's chill now oh okay chill is all right hey yo Shamone can you summon me some cruelty-free chicken tendies yeah governor before you go what do you make of this movement to have California secede from the United States oh I'm about it about it slim jim just off the Dome what do you think about the Republic of ginan as a name yeah I hate it I guess okay okay we'll Workshop it okay but I do know that if this does happen we're switching olivar dinero to ketas coin to what to ke what is Kus coin it's the Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony ketas sick new crypto and it's going to the Moon what I've got you got to get it put it in you what I've got you got to get it put it in you

      "which is the best off-road the new Toyota Land Cruiser The Good Old Land Rover Defender or a Jeep Wrangler well we're going to find out by comparing them in a series of off-road challenges off I'm Matt Watson and you're watching carwow I'm going to tell you how this is going to work so we're going to Mark each card depending on how they perform in each test the one that wins the test gets three points the one that comes second gets two points the one that comes last gets one point though if a vehicle doesn't finish a challenge it get no points the one with the most points at the end wins so this first challenge is a drag race up this hill I'm not confident about this I've got the heaviest car I've got the least power I'm on the most muddy part of the track and I'm on allterrain tires whereas the other two are on mud tires if this wins it's a miracle I know you Tire of Fanboys get mad this is not fair this is not fair Tires Tires Tires but here we are these are the tires that Toyota sent on the car and they knew what we were doing with it those tires on the Jeep they're the ones that are ordered with it and the Land Rover has some similar ties to what you can order with it they're not the standard ones they're upgraded like off-road tires but they're similar to those just a different brand anyway let's do this I'm just making excuses before I get going right then team so in the Jeep we have the Lovely Sam lovely racing driver Sam who can also drive cars Offroad the jum you can do any form of driving that you want you can even drive cattle and sheep aren you only Irish cattle and sheep and in the Land Rover driving his own car is hello Matt it's Andy hello again Andy um you didn't bring your 458 Special to this event this time it's a bit weird what why not yeah I thought i' been some a little bit more suited to conquer this event right let's do it Graham we've got the beautiful Graham he's going to be judging everything he's our off-road expert and he's about to start the race 2 1 [Music] wo Victory bloody out [Music] uh Andy are you still with us yeah I'm still here it's a bit slippery at the top Andy was above me I don't think anyone is going to push that car as hard as you are today I wouldn't even treat a press vehicle like that anyway clear wind for the Land Cruiser anything you'd like to say sam he was genuinely above me Toyota I mean what I'm not even on like the proper tires no just gripped and way it went three points to the Toyota two to the Jeep no his Defender was second way third whoa whoa whoa Sam what he beat you I know he did well done Andy it was worth it Well Done representing Land Rover there three to the Toyota two to the Land Rover and one to the Jeep for this next challenge we're going to test the cars agility their mobility and of course just how much punishment they can soak up so we're going to drive through this little bit in the woods go round a fre to come out the other end and Graham will be timing us on the fastest car wins okay then Graham take it away 2 1 terrible start Sam that's good through there whoa who watch it mate [Music] gram what time did we get there 16.2 second considering his start was rubbish that's really good okay Andy go on Graham count him in 2 1 better startop the Sam we're not going quite as fast now I thought Andy would absolutely be pedal to the metal this car slightly bigger turning circle of 12.8 which is the same as this Land Cruiser he's made it R quite gingerly he hasn't beaten some he took that quite steady yeah that's over 20 seconds isn't it 20.68 20.68 so I'm going be tactical I don't think I can beat Sam but I think I can beat that 3 2 1 come on get around get Get Grip Get Grip doesn't got grip bloody hell this is absolutely me absolutely it my tires that really went against me I got beaten didn't I 23 I just understeered at the top I was going in too quickly so I couldn't make it round the turn and that knackered me so I went two wheel high rear wheel drive that's why had such a bad start but I drifted around the top I don't have the option to go rear wheel drive anyway scores we've got three two one yeah 3 2 1 so wait a minute it's all Square Four Points each interesting testing the next challenge is all about controlling the vehicles as they drive down a slope but not using any human intervention we're going to be using their Hill descent control we' all got them in their low range mode we've got their Hill descent controls engaged and we are able to change the actual speed of the Hill descent control in This Land Cruiser and in the defender gr's going to start the race this not a race the idea is to come last 3 2 1 oh yes how's your feet they're tuck back I reckon you could climb from there into here yeah Sam's a stunt man come on do some stunts I don't know I'm falling down the hill don't fall over I can't I keep my leg keeps hitting the stick steering wheel oh you rubbish stunt man I think I was ahead of you yeah you are ahead of me no but when we started you're a man of many complaints I'm just going to relax protest oh shut up Sam I think I'm going to win this it's just so chill I think you're on the grippy side of the runway Sam your wheels weren't slipping it was nothing to do with that just accept the fact that you didn't win grae do you want to come over here let's see if grem will fall over in the mud here's a little a remind of why I keep saying it right in so three points three points how good was this though I know road tires as well yeah shut up with your formal protest I'm on road tires so you got no excuse three to the Toyota two to the Jeep and one to the Land Rover that means that the scores are seven to the Toyota six to the Jeep five to the Land Rover right this next challenge is the rock crawl we're going to be directed by grahe over the set of rocks and the car that does it with the most finesse and the easiest will win so gr will actually be marking each of the cars and his decision is final all right we're all going to run in low range mode best settings for rock crawl so I think we've all got rock crawl mode I'm going to decup on my rear stabilizer bar the Jeep is going to Decap all both of it do front and rear formal protest gra just a quick question should I have my diffs lock if you want everything you can lock locked my chassity belt cuz Sam's about you couldn't afford me Princess how much are you it's got good ground clearance that and look at the articulation easy it's got a rigid axle at the rear rigid axle at the front it's really going to help it with this oh going to put my window up [Music] oh I mean that's what a Jeep Wrangler is made to do do you know what Sam that's the first time I've wanting to be in the Jeep and not this that was just so good it's going to be interesting to see how this Land Rover fares now with its fully independent suspension it does have the most ground clearance but it just won't have the articulation I don't think but let's find out it's got perhaps the cleverest traction control system really good Electronics in this car which will help it with this and if it gets close it done a good job because on road I mean night and day difference between the two you really do feel the downsides of having an off-road setup in the Jeep when you drive on the road cuz it's pretty horrid on road whereas the defender lovely that actually did really well okay my go I'm going to put my central diff in first and then my rear diff we are good to go low range mode here we go God I can barely see him over the long bonnet oh oh oh [Music] oh that was disappointing right in gram right was exhaust it was exhaust yeah okay did I take the exact same line exact same line so not driver error not driver error it's lost is it this yeah Defender won that cuz it didn't touch at all it was so good Jeep were very close second it only took momentarily on that first drop three points to the landro over two to the Jeep and one to the Land Cruiser that means the scores are eight for the Land Cruiser eight for the Jeep and eight for the defender it's level everything to play for this next challenge is called the steps and it's going to test the car's chassis articulation see how much wheel travel they have grahe is going to direct us up here and he'll be looking at the cars and gauging how smoothly and controlled they go up there he'll be looking for minimal wheel spinning especially when the wheels are in the air okay the defender is going to go first oh look at that front wheel in the air not spinning away just steadily driving forward that is a good job there by that Land Rover that did really well considering it doesn't have rigid axles it's Superior ground clearance is really helping it there then back down again please Andy the same way that you came I mean look at that I think this Lan Cruiser will over that point cuz that defender's nose is so close to touching look at that traction on that front right wheel just the way it's just managing the slip so good that was a piece of cake wasn't it Andy it's just too easy the confidence this car gives you in like everywhere you go is just phenomenal I love it over to you now Sam you have the most focused hardcore offroader here so should be made for this kind of thing no pressure Matt this is confidence it's going to serve you right if you spill that I really hope you do if you don't spill any you should get bonus Point blind me look at the chassis articulation on that jeep it just looks so cool confidence inspiring Sam stop showing off with your coffee I'm definitely winning this Graham oh oh oh oh don't spill your coffee sunshine do you know what happened there at that point in time that noise that was the sound of the Jeep losing to the defender that scraped as well they both scraped oh right we'll wait we'll wait till the end don't get carried away so we'll wait gr's final decision let all vehicles run fast S Bar off diffs on we're all good come on do not bottom out we're just walking forward steady oh this is doing so well so far so very very good from the Land Cruiser it's all down to this descent don't touch I feel like I might topple over now this is the bit where I might drop Don't touch don't touch didn't touch I'm happy with that gram come hither there is one car that didn't touch to be honest I was expecting this one to come last it's one though isn't it one no Jeep second second if you say this came last I'm going to have a it's second Sam calm down I'll take that there's a Defender though great you love Land Rovers let's just put this up because they're just going to continue arguing so it's three to the Land Cruiser two to the Jeep Wrangler and one to the Land Rover Defender that means that the scores are 11 to the Toyota yay 10 to the Jeep and nine to the Land Rover if you're changing your car then you got to check out carwow because there's nothing quite like knowing that you're getting a great price both when selling your old car and finding a new one carwow makes all the stuff that's hard work about car changing like the haggling the no shows and the nasty surprises a thing of the past lifechanging now if you want to go to car while right now I've put a link Link in the description of this video and the Ping comment alternatively you can click on the pop out Banner appearing in the top right hand cor the screen now or scan the QR code on screen using your mobile phone to go directly there car change car wow in this next challenge we're going to see how well these vehicles cope with a side slope one is a simple side slope so they're going to drive down there but then we're going to drive around the corner and just Crest at an angle over a slope once again gra will be marking them on their capability off you go then Sam I don't like it wow that's did so well I mean look at that side angle that is nuts that was terrifying I don't like that it's offroading stuff's horrible it was really good I mean you're at such a crazy angle like 45° almost no it's got to go over the side slope oh oh that looks awful that's an evil root Gro you bad bad man oh that was [Music] horrible oh stayed on the ground okay go on then Andy get lined up time for the defender that smashed it that did I think you might suffer from not having rigid axles Here Andrew a bit oh it's got one wheel in the air already see doesn't have the chassis articulation it's doing all right though I mean that's a crazy angle for such a tall vehicle so the maximum only showed I believe it was 18° great must have been\n",

      "this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion as reported by CNBC out of all the countries on Earth Vietnam will see the sharpest increase in wealth over the next decade why well it's because in the background they've been positioning themselves to become the new Global manufacturing Hub after China many companies are ramping up manufacturing efforts in Vietnam including Apple Samsung and Intel so what you might be thinking having the projected fastest growth in the next decade might be a nice achievement but what's the big deal well what makes this success story so incredible is that just in a single generation Vietnam went from one of the poorest nations in the world to a middle- inome economy to really understand how radical Vietnam's rise is you must comprehend its history the Perpetual struggle of war and how it all turned around for them in this episode we explore the emerging Dark Horse on the economic Global stage Vietnam we'll see their struggles and how this massive transformation took place and we'll also see the challenges that it yet has to overcome you are watching cold fusion [Music] TV so what comes to mind when you think about Vietnam for many younger people it might be a budget friendly Southeast Asian Gateway with stunning Landscapes but for those a bit older it might evoke images of a poor country with dense jungles soldiers trudging through thick foliage ravaged Villages and scenes of fleeing refugees a land of hardship and strife this imagery was largely influenced by mainstream Western media it was all over the news but also films like platoon and Full Metal Jacket portrayed the brutality of the Vietnam War but now in the mid 2020s this is simply a distant memory today the Lively streets of hoochi Min City Vietnam's largest Metropolis are filled with the buzz of motorbikes and aroma of street food and an energy of a Nation on the rise in the country's capital Hanoi skyscrapers Stand Tall high-tech industrial parks Buzz with activity and luxury Brands line the streets the city's Lively atmosphere can be felt there's young professionals everywhere and they're leading the charge creating everything from startups to sustainable agriculture the Boost in Economic Development has contributed to a significant rise in living standards but in Vietnam there's a saying Gua low guwan which in English Loosely translates to in hardship wisdom emerges and this couldn't be more fitting for the story we're about to tell Vietnam was under French colonial rule for nearly a century starting in the mid 19th century Vietnam became part of French Indochina Federation of French Colonial territories in Southeast Asia including Laos and Cambodia under French rule the country's resources were exploited for the benefit of the colonial power Vietnamese people faced har treatment forc labor and heavy taxation after nearly a century of Oppression resentment was quietly growing there was a strong desire for Independence among the Vietnamese people the desire had given rise to a revolutionary movement and it was led by hoochi Min he spent years abroad studying and rallying international support for Vietnam's cause he was an interesting character standing at 5'5 he wasn't physically intimidating and strangely he actually respected the Dem values of France but he thought that the French practicing colonialism was hypocritical although hii Min stated that he didn't like violence if anyone got in his way he would crush them later revered as the founding father of modern Vietnam hoi Min became the leader of the vietman a communist-led resistance group dedicated to ending colonial rule the Vietnamese were finally going to fight back there was an attempt for a peaceful resolution with the French but after peace talks broke down the struggle for Independence culminated in war in 1946 it was a war between hoi men's resistance Army and French forces the brutal conflict dragged on for nearly a decade France's control over Vietnam was heavily weakened after the second world war in 1954 the French were finally forced to negotiate the agreement was to split Vietnam in half the North and the South and this division would set the stage for the country's next chapter in history so now Vietnam was no longer under French rule but the road to reunification was far from smooth the peace was fragile and tensions between the Communist North led by hoochi Min and the anti-communist South quickly escalated the United States fearing a spread of Communism in Southeast Asia began to support the South Vietnamese government but the USA's full involvement only made matters worse these are US soldiers fighting on Vietnam's front lines they are giving their lives they are not just giving their advice to a degree Never foreseen by Kennedy we hold the destiny of Vietnam in our hands and it holds ours in essence the war was as much a battle of ideologies as it was a struggle for control from 1955 to 1975 Vietnam was engulfed in a brutal war that brought unimaginable suffering and destruction the American intervention marked by extensive bombing campaigns ground operations and millions of soldiers and total made headlines around the world the Youth of America protested against the war causing a social divide locally between Generations the war in Vietnam is no longer simply their War to win or lose it's ours as well and it has become the most divisive in a 100 Years of American History do the results match the effort student protests in 1970 at Kent State University saw a brutal Crackdown from the US National Guard resulting in the deaths of four students students the event shocked the world and this incident culturally later became known as the official end of the peace era of 1960s America the war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon the capital of South Vietnam after the fall Saigon was renamed hoi Min City in honor of the North Vietnamese leader finally the country was reunified under a socialist republic however the newly formed Vietnam faced a severe hardship the economy was en rued infrastructure was destroyed and agriculture crippled more than anything the war left an irreparable scar on the Vietnamese people Millions died Villages were burnt to the ground and families were torn apart the land was scarred by chemical defoliators the effects of which are still felt today the devastation of this war is well documented but I just want to give you an estimation on the level of Destruction about 1 to 3 million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians 300,000 cambodians 20,000 to 60,000 Lans and 58,000 US service members died in the conflict around 4.6 million tons of bombs were dropped on Vietnam it caused extensive damage to the countryside and infrastructure over the span of two decades a total of 3 million people from Laos Cambodia and Vietnam fled their countries according to the unhcr 800,000 of these refugees were Vietnamese who escaped by boat later to become known as the boat people of Vietnam so to recap Vietnam endured nearly a century under French colonial rule facing harsh treatment and exploitation hoi Min led the Revolutionary movement for Vietnamese Independence culminating in the first Indochina War a war with his resistance Army against the French in 1954 Vietnam achieved independence from French colonial rule the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975 involved a significant us participation the conflict ended with the reunification of the country under a socialist [Music] regime so after Decades of fighting and destruction Vietnam was left in ruins it was one of the poorest nations of the world the GDP per capita was hovering between $150 and $300 in the late 1980s to 1995 to give you an idea today in GDP per capita terms that would make it the second poorest country on on Earth ahead of Bundi and just below Afghanistan back then in Vietnam the struggle to rebuild was immense the path to recovery seemed daunting under a strict socialist system many refugees did return to their country and the streets of Hanoi and hoi Min City started to bustle with activity again yet the air was thick with the weight of economic despair the people in power knew that something needed to be done in December of 1986 the government introduced a policy called doy Moy the doy Mo reforms meaning renovation or innovation were born out of necessity and a desire for Renewal the initiative led by prime minister Nan Kong hon aimed to transition Vietnam from a command economy to a socialist oriented market economy the initial steps were cautious but significant everything was State controlled so in that context here are some key points and Milestones this reform achieved over time in the north leaders of Agriculture cooperatives who were respons ible for managing Collective farming efforts were now allowed to rent out land to individual Farmers this marked a shift away from strict government control Farmers gained more control over their plots allowing them to manage their own production and keep any surplus beyond their quotas this change revitalized agricultural output and boosted the rural economy provincial governments were given the freedom to create their own trading companies breaking the state's tight grip on foreign trade private markets for agricultural products emerged and price controls over consumer goods were lifted this allowed trade to flourish at market-driven prices the reforms extend far beyond agriculture the 1987 foreign investment law took manufacturing facilities out of the hands of the state and allowed foreign investors to establish businesses own property and make a profit at the same time domestic private Enterprises were encouraged to be established this led to a surge in domestic companies however the full potential potential of these reforms was initially hampered by a us trade embargo which had been in place since 1975 seemingly a Remnant from the Vietnam War but when the United States finally lifted the Embargo in 1994 the landscape of Vietnam's economy began to change [Music] dramatically among the first to recognize Vietnam's potential were Global Giants Nike and Adidas Nike set up a factory in Vietnam just one year after the Embargo lifted Adidas was soon to follow these companies saw an opportunity Vietnam had a favorable investment climate and a cheap labor force something which isn't always good and we'll get to that in a sec but right now Nike works with over 100 suppliers in Vietnam starting in the early 2000s Adidas began establishing multiple factories across Vietnam by 2021 Vietnam had become the country's largest sourcing country contributing to roughly 40% of its total Footwear production in 2021 Vietnam exported foot Ware to over 100 countries with production climbing to around 17.8 billion us today many Brands such as Zara and H&M have factories in Vietnam and there's $455 billion of total registered capital in the form of direct foreign investments into Vietnam there's almost 40,000 of these foreign investment companies and within those companies over 1,300 of them are fashion brands when factories open new jobs are created for the local Vietnam people in 20111 21% of employees were working in the industry and Manufacturing sector today this is over 33% there's also opportunities for high- skilled jobs such as managerial positions though of course it's not all sunshine and rainbows though sadly there are companies that use exploitative practices and diminish the rights of the workers but despite that in aggregate there has been upward Mobility for those in Vietnam between 1993 and 2014 Vietnam raised around 40 million people out of poverty during this period the poverty rate plummeted from nearly 60% to 14% but there's still much more to be done and we'll touch on that later today Vietnam's economy is growing up 5.8% while the global average is 2.9% so what's going on here well in Vietnam it's mix of smart trade policies Savvy domestic reforms and Hefty investments in infrastructure and human capital analysts from the World Bank and Brookings Institute suggest that there are three key factors driving Vietnam's continued economic growth let's take a closer look at these points number one trade agreements and liberalization Vietnam has strategically opened its Market through key trade agreements joining the Asian free trade area in 1995 a deal with the US in 2000 and joining the WTO in 20 2007 are notable examples since then Vietnam has secured trade agreements with China India Japan and Korea a 2018 trade deal with other countries like Australia New Zealand Malaysia Singapore Canada and Mexico and another trade deal with the EU in 2020 now joined the list these deals Poise Vietnam to be a future export Powerhouse number two domestic reforms Vietnam has complemented its external openness with some crucial domestic reforms these include deregulation and an effort to reduce the cost of doing business red tape and hassle are being minimized as a result in 2023 alone Vietnam attracted nearly $ 36.6 billion in foreign direct investment okay so what does that mean well it's extremely significant because that's a 32.1% increase from just the previous year it's an absolute rocket ship but in saying that there's also the point of appearing tough on corruption it's a point which we talked about with the case of trong Myan after bribing everyone and stealing 3% of the nation's GDP she was sentenced to death it's a signal that Vietnam is getting serious even if it is just on the surface okay number three investing in capital with a population of 35 million half of whom are under 35 Vietnam has prioritized Public Funding for primary education and infrastructure it seems like they know the value of an educated and young Workforce Vietnam has always been an export heavy country its economy was once rooted in agriculture they had exports like wet rice coffee and black pepper but from 2008 to 2018 agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined as the industrial sector took off today it might surprise a lot of people but Vietnam stands out as a major player in the technology Hardware space in 2023 they exported 57.3 billion dollars worth of electronic devices computers and parts globally the country now ranks seventh in electronics exports this highlights a rapid change there's a growing presence of Global Tech companies such as Samsung Apple Intel and foxcon in Vietnam in fact such companies are flocking to the country eager to invest in and capitalize on its booming Market let's take a look at a few examples Samsung the company produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam they're planning to boost investment from 18 billion to 20 billion in the near future since 2019 Apple's total Investments have exceeded 16 billion creating over 200,000 jobs in Vietnam and Tim Cook is investing heavily in Vietnam analysts forecast that by 20125\n",

      "- [Johnny] This is a battlefield where both armies have the same weapons capabilities, but one of them has AI and the other does not. Let's see how a battle between these two plays out. In the process, we'll learn why Vladimir Putin once told a group of young students that whoever leads an AI will rule the world, and why The White House recently issued its first memo on AI, calling it an era-defining technology with significant and growing relevance to national security. To understand this, I've teamed up with Shashank Joshi. - Hello. Good afternoon, Johnny. - [Johnny] The Defense Editor at 'The Economist' who's likely one of the most knowledgeable people on the planet when it comes to this topic. - [Johnny] We're beginning to see artificial intelligence pretty much in every single decision made in war. So let me show you how artificial intelligence is transforming war. So let me clarify, this is not a sponsorship with 'The Economist.' There's a sponsor later on in the video. This is a partnership and kind of a dream come true to work with this newspaper that I've been reading since I was in college studying international relations. So I'm really just shouting them out because I feel an immense amount of gratitude for what they've taught me about the world. In addition to their excellent short form video, they've also started giving away access to their short form news app called Espresso for free to high School and college students who are over 16. Super cool. Again, not a sponsor. I just wanna get the word out here. So now let's get back into this video. - The examples that compel people the most are often the munition, the weapon system, the thing that does the killing, and this is the killer drone, a killer robot, but what I think is that often the key decisions in war are not the ones that the very end, they're not the ones that happen just before a bomb goes bang. And I think that's where AI is really affecting the battlefield the most. - Okay, so we've made these two hypothetical armies. Here on the battlefield, both of these armies are effectively trying to do the same thing. They're both trying to somehow get eyes into enemy territory, to find the enemy's most valuable military targets, to fix their exact location, to determine what weapons to use and how to properly target and deploy them, and then to actually fire on those targets, to engage so that it actually hits the target. And then finally, to assess to see if it worked. This is called the kill chain, and it is how war is fought. But executing this kill chain is not straightforward. It's the job of commanders on both sides to make countless decisions, often with incomplete or unreliable information, and victory tends to favor those who can gather the best information and make accurate decisions the fastest. So let's see how both of these sides approach their kill chain, one with AI and one without. Hey, before we get back onto the battlefield, I'm currently in my home with a sweatband on because I am exercising, which is something I have to do every day to be a happy adult. I'm telling you all this because it has to do with the sponsor today's video, who's Trainwell, which is a platform that connects you with a personal trainer who designs a workout for you that you can do right in your home using this very cool app. So here's how it works. Devon's been my personal trainer on this app for like a couple years now. I told him all my goals, which for me is like I just wanna be able to like lift my body and like be functionally strong. And then he designs a workout for me. It's all visual, which I love, and it comes not just with photos, but with actual videos of exactly what I'm supposed to be doing. This makes a huge difference for me for some reason, like at six in the morning when I don't really wanna be working out, but I know my day will be better if I do, having just a flow of looped videos telling me exactly what I'm supposed to do and then a button that I can press to be like 'I completed this workout' is awesome, and then I can give feedback to Devon. I can be like, 'Hey, the abs part was too difficult today. Can you make it a little easier tomorrow?' Or something like that. Oh, and if the personal trainer you're assigned isn't a good fit, you can switch it anytime. Devon has sketched out my whole week based on my goals, and so every day, there's a different workout. I still get to have goals, I still get to give feedback, but I don't have to make any of the decisions. There's a professional personal trainer doing that for me, and I don't have to leave my home, which like I just never got into the habit of going to the gym. For me, working out is a non-negotiable. I have to exercise to be a happy adult. And having something that takes away all the decision making and keeps me accountable, that is the key for consistency for me. If you wanna try this out, you can get 14 days for free if you use the link in my description, go.trainwell.net/johnnyharris. Clicking that link help support the channel, but it also gives you 14 days for free on this platform. I appreciate Trainwell for sponsoring today's video for supporting our journalism. We are now going to leave my home, go back onto the battlefield to see how AI is changing the nature of war. (dramatic music) - Well, militaries will use what they call sensors to go find things, that could be anything that looks at the world. - [Johnny] Both have all sorts of sensors that are looking into their enemy's territory. - [Shashank] The classic example is an electro-optical sensor on a satellite, right? And that's fancy words for a camera that is just looking at stuff. - [Johnny] They both have drones in the air scanning for targets. - [Shashank] A reconnaissance team on the ground. - [Johnny] They've got radar sensing what's flying through the air. The data from the sensors is being recorded and eventually is sent back to a central command center. This is where the decisions are made on what the army will do next using all of this data from their sensors. - So someone has to be sifting through all the satellite images. - And this is where we see the first big advantage for the side with AI, computer vision. - Object recognition has just exploded in how good it is. If you look back at the way that AI broke through and advanced around 2012, it was picking out images, in particular recognizing images of cats, and if you can recognize a cat, you can recognize a tank. - [Johnny] The AI command center is armed with computer vision software that is processing all of this incoming visual data and tagging it with what they think they're looking at and its precise location. - [Shashank] Now you have machines automatically looking over those images, picking out enemy planes, enemy formations and saying, 'Hey, I think with 90% probability, that I'm pretty sure is a tank, and I've worked this out on the drone itself, the exact coordinates it's at.' - The other military that doesn't have AI is doing the same thing, but without computer vision algorithms. - [Shashank] There's a lot of friction in this process. You had humans pouring over every single image. - [Johnny] They're slowly identifying their targets. A tank here, an airfield there, plotting them on a map, doing it manually. Oh, and by the way, this map only exists here in this command center. They haven't even started communicating all of these targets and intelligence to other command centers. Meanwhile, the computers over in this other command center are automatically adding all of their findings to a database that's in the cloud that other command centers have access to as well. - An AI-enabled army is fusing all kinds of data, mobile phone records, data from ship tracking websites, aircraft tracking websites, consumer retail activity, who is buying products near this naval base or near that airfield that might indicate activity. So you're fusing these vast torrents of data, spitting out anomalies. - So their maps are filling up much quicker, filling up with potential targets, and even context on each of these targets. - A commander who sees the targets then has to decide a lot of things. Are they gonna hit them or not? Is it valuable enough? What am I gonna use? Do I use a plane, an artillery battery, something else? These are all basically the bread and butter of any command decision. - But this is still just the beginning of the kill chain. These are hard decisions, but the AI-enabled commander has some help. A software platform has fused all of this data together and is starting to make predictions and inferences, giving recommendations to the commander, taking into account not only the target they're trying to hit, but also many other important factors. - I know that you have this many planes. I know that you have this much fuel on the airfield, this much ammunition. Here is the optimal way to destroy that target using these aircraft, coolant, fuel, oil, repairs, rest for the crew, food for the crew. These are all so fundamental. So a lot of the stuff that was being done in your headquarters by dozens of mid-level officers with pens, papers, spreadsheets can be done by software. So a human might be able to do all of these things, but it might take them like a couple of days to do it. The code can do it in like a 10th of the time, way, way more quickly. - So while the traditional army is still manually plotting potential targets, the AI army's commander is looking at a list, a list generated by his software, a list of targets. The software is proposing that they could hit a group of tanks that they found near the front line. They could take out a bridge that serves as an important supply line. They could target an ammunition depot that the AI believes that most of the enemy's ammunition reserves are being held. The commander evaluates these recommendations from the software and decides to target the ammunition depot using some artillery cannons that the software has confirmed have recently been serviced and have plenty of ammunition for this operation. He taps a few buttons on a screen, and a mix of humans and software start preparing to engage. This all happened very quickly. And over on the other side, they're just starting to assemble an initial list of valuable targets. The AI-enabled commander now has time to think about other potential targets. Its software is recommending that he send a swarm of drones with explosives attached to them to destroy this fleet of enemy tanks. And here's where we see yet another massive advantage of AI. These drones are piloted by humans, but as they get closer and closer to their target, the enemy sends out jamming signals to interfere with the connection between the pilot and the drone. - Suddenly, I'm not able to pilot my drone because there's all this radio noise overwhelming the signal. - [Johnny] The pilot can no longer control the drone. - What if the drone didn't need to have a pilot? - [Johnny] Thanks to recent advances in AI, this drone can start flying itself. - It is looking at the object, it's comparing it to a library of images stored on the platform, and it's saying, 'I know I am supposed to hit this thing.' So it locks onto the target and it says, 'I am gonna just keep going, I can maneuver to that target' in the final last 100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters of flight.' That's a real shift in the character of warfare when you have that precision guidance, not just on exquisite high-end systems, but on so many tiny little systems throughout the battlefield, - You can see where this is going. The AI-enabled army is able to pull off these attacks much quicker with way more information, all enabled by algorithms that are crunching huge amounts of data. So even though these two armies have the same hardware, what matters more and more is what's inside. - What really matters is the software. What really matters is the algorithm inside. - Okay, so this was a hypothetical and simplified scenario, but in the real world, this is effectively the direction that warfare is going. Relying more and more on software. Let's go through a few examples. Like in Gaza, where the Israeli military uses data from tapped phones and people's locations to algorithmically choose targets to strike. - There's a kind of AI target system generating huge numbers of targets per day of suspected Hamas militants. - [Johnny] According to six Israeli soldiers speaking to an Israeli publication, the IDF has based a lot of its airstrikes off of AI-generated lists, treating these target lists in their words, 'As if it were a human decision.' Now the IDF does dispute this characterization, but the point is AI algorithms are already being used on the battlefield to choose targets. Then there's Ukraine. - Ukraine above all is going to be the key test bed because that's where we're seeing some of the most advanced military AI play out on both sides, tested, experimented. - The major innovation here has been in drones, something we made a whole video about. More and more software and computer vision is allowing these drones to complete the final leg of their flight, to hit their target even when the signal has been jammed and the pilot has lost control of the drone. Here in the United States, we are seeing more and more tech startups who are preparing for this new form of warfare. One that relies so much more on sensors and data and algorithms that can make sense of it all to make wartime decisions. - This is all about autonomy, and that will be delivered more than anything else by software. - The US military has been developing an AI system that can take a massive amount of aerial and satellite imagery and pick out potential enemy targets, sometimes more accurately than humans can. The UK has a similar program, and because data from sensors is such a huge part of this capability, you see more cloud\n",

      "shares in the advanced computer chip one of the wor if the Chinese company hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion look at these stock market charts from the 28th of January 2025 what you're looking at is a blood bath a blood bath in the US Stock Market of over $1 trillion and the cause the release of the deep seek R1 AI model from China the Chinese model is as capable as the best US models but it's free to use open source more efficient and most shocking of all it reportedly cost less than 3% of chat gp01 to develop just 2 years ago on this channel we were talking about an AI arms race between companies today that's evolved into an AI race between countries in the one corner we have the United States they have a long history of technological dominance but then on the other side we have China a country with a very different ideology and motives in this race to dominance it's not about weapons but it's about developing systems that are designed to think artificial intelligence this race is reminiscent of the Cold War some have even dubbed these events as quote the Sputnik moment of AI the White House says that they're looking into quote National Security implications of China's deep- seek AI platform and to top it all off open AI has accused deep seek of stealing its IP to train their own model it's all heating up with the United States pouring in half a trillion dollars into the Stargate AI project the global race is on and this ongoing battle could be one of the biggest stories in Tech this year as artificial intelligence becomes a matter of National Security the technology would be forced to move faster than it is today what a crazy time to be alive but before we get ahead of ourselves what is really going on here how did a company from nowhere do all of this is this all just part of the AI hype cycle or is this the real deal it seems like the whole world is playing catch-up since the release so let's try and make sense of it all you are watching cold fusion TV historically when technology meets a national security threat from an ideological opponent we get inventions like the computer and jet aircraft from the competition of World War II for example but this time around the United States was completely unchallenged in the field of AI for the most part but that all changed on January 20th 2025 with the release of R1 deep seek R1 which is free has performance reportedly on par with open ai's $200 a month model and this is performance in the context of tasks such as language reasoning mathematics and coding the free model also beats out anthropics Claude CET and Google's Gemini but what many people may not know is that deep seek does things a little bit differently to the current state-of-the-art models it's in part why it's so efficient but we'll cover these details later in the episode because there's no competition for that level of AI performance for free users have been flocking to it with deep seek becoming number one in Apple's App Store but here are the stats of why people's Jaws are dropping the AI was built in 2 months and reportedly cost less than 5.6 million to build the AI company anthropic says that 100 million to 1 billion is the general amount needed to develop an AI system from scratch and to that end meta plans to spend 65 billion on AI so creating something that performs this well with just $5.6 million is groundbreaking but all may not as it seems more on that later seeing much more um I think there were two very important things that people need to know about what's happening with deep SE Ki and the way it's being interpreted on Wall Street the first is it doesn't matter if it's a Chinese government scop or not the technological innovation of having an llm train itself through reinforcement learning is impressive the cost efficiency of doing inference with only s ion parameters rather than 700 billion parameters is impressive the possibility of being able to do more model training and inferencing with less usage of power and less chips is impressive it doesn't mean though that chip demand is at risk what I think it means is you're more likely to see an acceleration of AI everywhere all over the economy deep seek R1 being open source means that its code is freely available for whoever wants to use it and for whatever they want to use it for users can modify it as they please all for free this is totally the opposite approach of open AI which is pretty ironic this is all horrific news for us AI companies because it means that suddenly their costs are all out of balance deep seek with its 671 billion parameters can run locally on a stack of M4 Mac Pros in contrast investors and comp companies have poured billions of dollars into American AI servers after the shock of this release now it looks like us companies have been spending too much money using too much energy and charging too much for the services that they've been providing maybe in the future it's not going to be so much the models that would make the most money but the applications that run on top of them has this all been a massive mistake from us investors no one knows for sure and that's why the markets are selling off one bright spot for us companies though is that users of AI systems may not feel comt able in giving their data directly to China especially in corporate settings in order to compete Sam ultman CEO of the chat GPT maker open AI has announced that their GPT 30 Mini model will now be given away for free as for Mark Zuckerberg and meta they're internally panicking but it's not just the Americans over in China the effect is the same other Chinese Tech Giants such as bite dance the maker of Tik Tok Alibaba and tensent have freaked out and had to cut the prices of their AI model to compete and despite the low price charged by Deep seek it remains profitable while its Rivals lose money interestingly open AI told the financial times that they have evidence that deep seek was using the output from chat GPT to train its own model in fact last year they blocked open AI API accounts that they believe belong to deep seek suspecting theft the US government's official stance is that it is possible that IP theft has occurred it should also be noted that it seems like Chinese AI Developers are still managing to get their hands on topof the line in video graphics cards despite us sanctions but that begs the question who are deep seek and how did deep seek seemingly overnight build this [Music] thing for a company responsible for one of the biggest red days in the US Stock Market not a lot is known about the founder and the team behind deep sea but the story is interesting so far deep seek founder leang win Fang isn't from the typical Tech world he actually has a background in finance and co-founded a hedge fund called high flyer his company used AI to predict market trends and help make investment decisions and he was very successful at that and his fund now manages 8 billion but after his initial success he wanted more his next goal was to build quote human level AI in 2021 he started buying thousands of Nvidia gpus as part of his quote AI side project this was right before the Biden Administration began limiting us export of AI Hardware to China leang Advent spun off his AI side project into another company and that company was deep seek and the R1 is their latest model but honestly The more I've been reading up on the leang story The more interesting it gets so let me know in the comment section if you want to see a dedicated episode on the Deep seek founder so deep seek R1 was trained with reinforcement learning that means there weren't any humans who helped it learn and the method that deep seek uses for their model architecture is different to most of the other players it's a technique called mixture of experts Sky News explains it well quote where open ai's latest model GPT 4 attempts to be Einstein Shakespeare and Picasso rolled into one deep seeks is more like a university broken up into expert departments this allows the AI to decide what kind of query it's being asked and then send it to a particular part of the digital brain to be dealt with this lets the other parts to remain Switched Off Saving Time energy and most importantly the need for computing power the YouTube channel computer file explains further so maybe you ask it a very specific maths question what mixed of experts will do is have trained a specific part of this network a much smaller part to solve that problem for you and so you basically have the early stages will root the question to different parts of the network and then only activate a small part of it let's say 30 billion parameters which is a huge huge saving so this sort of shaded area here will activate and then that will produce your answer you can develop systems using agents like this where you have one that's trained to do this and one that's trained to do this and you just ask the right one right suppose I want to train a network to write my emails for Me Maybe it's very good at that and then I train a different network to solve a different problem and I just ask the right one as opposed to hoping that one model can do it so that's much more efficient to add to the efficiency is a process called distillation basically using larger models to train smaller models in targeted domains the result is equivalent performance with significantly less computing power and this was the big shock for AI developers and financial markets making Chain of Thought reasoning completely open and visible was an interesting choice open AI basically does the opposite does is essentially write down a step-by-step process of solving the problem and slowly solve it and then write down the answer you tend to get much better at solving problems that require multiple steps if you want to just what is why is the sky blue it will just regurgitate that pretty easily from text it's learned on the internet but if you're asking like problem solving skills it's hard to do in one shot so you kind of take a little bit of time to just to just take you know to just work through it now open AI pioneered this Chain of Thought um but they don't tell you how they do it because it's all closed and so it's not open AI at all right in some sense so essentially you see a kind of pricey summary version of The Chain of Thought but it's not the internal actual internal monologue which is essentially a trade secret what R1 is doing is it's doing a Chain of Thought which is similar to 01 but it's fully public they've released all the models they've released all the code you can talk to it you can see the entire monologue and they've also trained it with a with massively more limited data so as mentioned earlier things may not be as they seem that cost figure of $5.6 million to create the model may not be complete in fact in a paper released by Deep seek themselves they mentioned that that $5.6 million figure includes only the official training of deep seek V3 and does not include cost of Prior research experiments on architectures algorithms or data that does put a question mark on all the headlines we've been seeing that this thing was built for under $6 million but whatever the real figure is it's likely to be much less than what US companies have been spending in the latest news deep seek has also dropped an open image model and at this rate a video model will probably soon follow and it might even rival open AI Sora or Google's anticipated V2 in terms of search interest right now deep SE now outpaces chat GPT and it became one of the most downloaded apps on the app store and then towards the end of January things absolutely blew up and went wild China during Chinese New Year went crazy first Alibaba comes out with Quinn 2.5 Max it's a very capable AI that could one-hot this code animation just asking a computer to code an animation and then it goes out and does it is so intuitive that I think kids of the future will believe that this is how coding always worked alibaba's quen 2.5 Max outperforms deep seek and even GPT 40 in some tasks and then there's kimy K 1.5 released around the same day it's also a great performer is multimodal and can browse the web in real [Music] time okay before you all rush out to sign up to deep seek Please be aware of something it collects data such as chat history any text or audio inputs uploaded files keystroke patterns B basically anything you input into the model now open AI does similar things but the difference is that with deep seek your data goes straight to servers in the People's Republic of China so I guess the question is do you want to be spied on by the us or do you want to be spied on by China I can't tell you what to do but that's just a heads up but in terms of privacy there is a bright side does mean that deep seek can

      "this video is brought to you by ground news welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion think of all the major Bank frauds that you've heard of from JP Morgan rigging precious metals markets to Wells Fargo making up fake consumer accounts and scamming customers to all of the banks involved in The Reckless greed of 2008 a disaster that damaged the global economy no justice is ever served nobody goes to jail and no one in power seems to care but what if the opposite happened what if white col criminals were served the ultimate punishment this is the story of a woman who's just been sentenced to death in Vietnam trong Myan didn't murder anyone she didn't traffic drugs she didn't commit treason but what she did do was commit a fraud so enormous that it amounted to around 3% of the entire country's GDP in the past few minutes a court in Vietnam has sentenced a wealthy proper developer to death for defrauding a bank of billions of dollars 67-year-old trong Milan was found guilty of embezzlement bribing State officials and violating Bank lending regulations after she used her hidden ownership of the Saigon Commercial Bank to channel $44 billion of loans to her own companies it's been described as one of the greatest Brank frauds in history and how for over a decade did this woman allegedly steal so much money without anyone taking her down get ready for a wild ride as we dive into one of the biggest fraud cases in history this is bigger than teros or Sam bankman freed and it's a scandal that stained Asia's fastest growing economy you are watching cold fusion TV Trang Milan was born in 1956 in Saigon South Vietnam to a modest but entrepreneurial family scared her story really begins at the benthan market an iconic and bustling Hub known for its intense bargaining culture Lan learned how to hustle from an early age as a teenager she and her mother became a familiar site at the market selling Cosmetics together detectives always look to a corporate's early life for clues about why they did what they later did but with Lan her early life doesn't give much away there were no telltale signs that we know of and nothing that would point to the criminal mastermind that she'd eventually become Lan's negotiating skills must have really been something because by the mid 1990s she ventured into the property market and founded F Thin fat group around this time Vietnam was undergoing a transformation reforms had opened the doors for private businesses and families to compete but land was officially under State control so getting access to it would require some serious charm in Your Arsenal to sway State officials trong my land's rise was as dramatic as her fault in 1992 she met Eric trueu napne an investor from Hong Kong they got married had two daughters and built an Empire of restaurants hotels and properties across Vietnam and Hong Kong and her wealth exploded if we check out our typical profile of a white collar criminal this all fits the bill with seemingly no reason to break the law so that's why it's always so infuriating when they do they get greedy and as you'll see they just want more and more and more around 2010 is when things start to go dodgy Mrs Lan was a major player in Vietnam's Financial scene and her company was one of Vietnam's richest real estate firms she was powerful and had good standing with the community because of this and presumably her connections she was entrusted with arranging the merger of three struggling Banks into the Saigon Commercial Bank which will call SCB in this video the plan was approved by Vietnam Central Bank big mistake from 2012 she began to siphon funds she gave loans to herself and her friends and paid bribes to government officials to keep them quiet and from here her power would remain unchecked for now so aren't there supposed to be laws to stop this from happening well there were Vietnamese law clearly caps an individual's ownership in a bank at 5% but somehow over the years she ended up owning 90% of the bank so how on Earth did she manage to own 90% step one in Lan's multi-billion Dollar Bank fraud scheme set up thousands of shell companies she put the ownership of these companies and Bank shares in other people's name so a cursory glance from the outside would look like a healthy and diverse range of leaders and CEOs controlling the bank's subsidiaries and partners but in reality it was just her whoops and then it became an inside job Lan stacked the deck with her own people she hired trusted Associates as managers at SCB and instructed them to approve loans to her network of shell companies around the world these companies often had no operations or employees she would use fake contracts to move money out of the country as the scheme grew she needed more people to be in charge of her ever growing list of fake companies her husband her niece and other family members got involved 93% of the approved loans at SCB went straight into Trung my Lan's pocket with this setup Lan now had billions of dollars in customer deposits to play with imagine finding out that each time you deposit money 93 cents out of every dollar disappears into one woman's personal piggy bank to do whatever they please in the decade leading up to arrest Lan lent herself $44 billion in illegal loans so how on Earth does no one notice that much money missing well it turns out that people did Lan was a household name in Vietnam her position at Saigon Commercial Bank held her in great esteem but her never-ending access to liquid Capital meant that it was pretty obvious that she was up to something her Shady dealings were an Open Secret yet she passed audits from Big names like de white and KPMG with flying colors even if a regulator became suspicious and decided to dig deeper Lan would hand out bribes like candy take the Chief Inspector of Vietnam State Bank do Nan who accepted a $5 million bribe this was the largest bribe ever recorded in Vietnam and it was delivered in Styrofoam boxes to put this bribe into context top government officials in Vietnam ear around $1,000 per month a $5 million bribe could set the inspector and her family up for life but instead life in jail is all she received it gets even crazier over the course of 3 years Lan instructed her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese Dong from the bank and store it in her basement this was the equivalent of $4 billion us even if he withdrew all of that cash in Vietnam's largest bank note denomination it would weigh 2 tons moving this kind of money without anyone noticing seems unlikely but that's the thing in a country when so many people are struggling to get by a bribe to look the other way can be life-changing that's why so many people accepted L's hush money and why she could get away with it for so long however her luck was about to run out and her Empire was about to collapse Vietnamese authorities were undertaking a scorched Earth policy on corruption [Music] the thing about Vietnam is that it's a one- party state so there's not always an incentive or competition to keep those in power honest however since 2013 one of Vietnam's most powerful politicians n Fu Chong had been leading an anti-corruption campaign called blazing furnace trong realized that corruption within the Communist party was actually a threat to their power and in order to regain the trust of the Vietnamese people they needed to create an image of a clean government for years the Blazing furnace campaign focused on public sector corruption in Vietnam talk of cracking down on corruption wasn't new and probably fell on a lot of deaf ears including those of Mrs Lan so while Lan was busy bribing and siphoning cash the Communist Party began to take corruption in the private sector more seriously as the US China trade War raged on companies scrambled to find new manufacturing locations the Communist Party knew this and through the Blazing furnace campaign they promised to make Vietnam a cleaner and safer place to do business foreign business investment poured in and companies like Samsung LG and apple pumped billions into high-tech manufacturing the anti-corruption drive was paying off and Vietnam became Apple's biggest manufacturing Hub outside of China but there was a flip side to this anyone found to be corrupt was going to be in hot water and the more corrupt you were the hotter the water and trong my landan was the most corrupt of all in October of 2022 Lan was arrested and less than 2 years later she was sentenced to death it sounds wild I know but the reason for this punishment is both surprising and not so surprising hang tight I'll explain in a bit but for now the initial Fallout from Lan's arrest was huge police identified around 42,000 victims Bond holders and ordinary people who trusted SCB with their life savings the court trial was televised and was a spectacle like the country had never seen the 104 boxes of evidence presented in the trial weighed 6 tons land's Empire was so massive that it brought a once strong housing market to its knees property firms shut down in record numbers and authorities seized over a thousand of lands properties highrises across Hanoi and hoim Min City now sit empty post arrest even Vietnam Central Bank had to step in to prevent a financial meltdown they pumped $24 billion in quote special loans into SCB to avoid a bankr run the government also turned to foreign investors to help stabilize the situation quote without lending SCB will collapse if the lending continues the national treasury will gradually dry up end quote ironically some analysts think that the arrest backfired and made foreign investment skittish right at the time when Vietnam was poised to be the next Global manufacturing hub in April of 2024 Trang Myan was sentenced to death for embezzling $ 12.5 billion and that's just the amount the authorities could prove to put that into perspective that's like someone in the United States stealing $ 7632 billion land's arrest shocked the nation but the death penalty verdict even more so capital punishment in Vietnam is relatively common but it's rarely applied in cases of financial crimes especially with someone with no prior convictions so what's the story behind the move well there's a lot of perspectives for One Time Magazine published Vietnam sought to make an example out of Lan end quot and this makes sense considering the verdict the defendants actions eroded people's trust in the leadership of the Communist party and state end qu but the question is was L sentencing more about politics than the justice for a victims potentially some experts think that the Communist party used her as a human sacrifice just to show the world that they were taking corruption seriously if Lan had just received a live sentence the story probably wouldn't have made Global headlines and authorities wouldn't be able to push their narrative others speculate that the whole thing could just be a ruse a method to terrify Lan into giving up more of her stolen assets and accompli they think that if she settles the outstanding debts of $28 billion maybe she'll be spared in the end land pled not guilty and blamed her subordinates she admitted that she was involved in the restructuring of the bank but did not misappropriate its funds she also told the court that by her getting into the banking industry without sufficient experience and quote a lack of understanding of legal matters got her into the situation the courts didn't buy it and all in all 855 people were charged including Lan's husband who was sentenced to 9 years in prison and Lan's niece who was sentenced to 17 years two former Executives of the SCB Bank have fled the country and are still on the run before we continue let's hear a quick word from today's sponsor ground news Apple has made Headway towards its first unionized

      "this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion Google is everywhere the company is just a part of daily life when you want a quick answer to something you just use Google without a second thought but what if there was a world where it wasn't just Google in that position but a whole host of other players that vision is what the Department of Justice in the US wants to see now Google has suffered a major legal blow after a US judge ruled it had acted illegally to Main contain a monopoly and stifle competition while generating huge profits the US attorney general described the ruling as quote an historic win for the American people in August of 2024 in an event called the biggest antitrust ruling of the century the doj has called Google a monopoly in the online search Market but since that ruling things have progressed now the doj are looking out ways to break up Google on September 6th 2024 a hearing was held to determine the plan for forward but in yet further escalation the doj is launching another antitrust case against Google in the coming days but in all of this there are still some questions here is this the beginning of the end for Google's era of online dominance do the government's actions actually help the average internet user or is there a bit more to the story might the Department of Justice be a bit heavy-handed on Google we'll have a fair look at both sides also stay tuned for the story of the Monopoly man all of that and more coming right up you are watching to Fusion TV so it's well known that Google dominates online search they make up about 90% of the search Market which has served them well Google makes over $75 billion yearly from search that's more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait Morocco Slovakia and Oman but recently this dominance has come into question in the landmark 286 page ruling of Google versus the United States the doj thinks that Google has gotten to this position due to unfair practices in other words the violation of antitrust laws so it's probably good to have some definitions before we go further according to the doj antitrust behavior is quote anti-competitive conduct that deprives American consumers taxpayers and workers of the benefits of competition end quote and part of this is a Monopoly Monopoly status isn't legally defined and it depends where you look but at 50 to 60% market share you're teetering on the edge and such a company may endure scrutiny at 70 to 75% you're most definitely a monopoly but the thing is the triggering of antitrust action also depends on the company's Behavior but 90% market share is definitely going to attract Regulators in any functioning government [Music] I read through some of the case document and there's a lot but there's two main things I want to cover Google charging higher prices because there's no competition and paying to keep the competition away and remember that these are not my opinions just the facts from the case an interesting note in the paper was that apparently in 2020 Google conducted a study to see what would happen to their bottom line if it quote were to significantly reduce the quality of its search product end quot the conclusion was that even if the company made search bad the revenue from search would still be fine on this the judge wrote quote the fact that Google can make product changes without concern that its users might go elsewhere is something only a firm with Monopoly power could do okay so let's dig deeper the case CES that since there's no other game in town for search advertising advertisers had no choice but Google in order to reach more people Google could then increase prices the other problem according to the ruling was that prices were raised incrementally to blend in with normal Market fluctuations and this was to reduce the likelihood of advertisers noticing incremental price changes led to consistent Revenue growth without significant complaints from advertisers Google went as far as to do internal studies to show that advertisers did indeed not notice and just thought that the price hikes were just part of the overall Market the doj also cites that Google tuned their mechanism for determining ad costs quote Google adjust the parameters of the auction function how advertisers bid for adspace in order to improve long-term Revenue this work has resulted in products which add several billion dollars in incremental Revenue annually end quote and this next point is pretty interesting the ruling goes on to say that when Google grew concerned about meeting its Revenue targets a code yellow was called basically it was an instruction to get all hands on deck to subtly raise Advertiser pricing without too many noticing the company knew they could do this yet again from more internal studies showing that advertisers would pay more than they currently were without leaving the judge stated quote the trial evidence firmly establishes Google's Monopoly power and has enabled Google to increase text ad prices without any meaningful competitive constraint I know what some of you would be saying well who cares about advertisers getting fleeced all advertisers do is track you and follow you around on the off chance that you'll buy something that you've previously been Googling and there is an argument to be made there but there's a second order consequence if advertisers have to pay higher cost to Google they can then turn around and pass some of that cost onto you the consumer Google has been paying Apple and Samsung billions of dollars annually to install Google as the default search engine on their smartphones and web browsers quote in return for exclusive and non-exclusive default placements Google pays Apple $20 billion in 2022 end quote this is apparently quote almost double the payment Google made in 2020 which at the time was 17.5% of Apple's operating profit so why would Google do this well consumers tend to buy more things on their phone and for iPhones quote Google receives almost 95% of General search queries end quote and with billions of iPhones out there that's a lot of ads which means a lot of Revenue the doj didn't like that quote Google's distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search Services market and impairs Rivals opportunities to compete end quote the doj thinks that it's actually the Monopoly on the phone browsing Market that enabled Google to consistently raise the prices of online advertising without consequences as we discussed earlier it turns out that back in the days of Steve Jobs and for a little bit after that Apple was looking to make their own search engine but they had a search Project in the works when Steve Jobs was in charge over there they were looking at search because he had such an ax to grind with Eric Schmidt because they launched Android and he kicked Eric Schmidt off the board and there was a lot of hand ringing there I think apple is and i' I've heard this from folks around Apple I believe Apple's going to launch their own search engine and compete heads up with Google but now Google has Apple in golden handcuffs with a$ 20 billion yearly deal in the contract apple is basically not allowed to innovate on any of their own search engines the judge also scolds Google for destroying and hiding evidence they allege that Google trained employees to not leave a paper trail or quote bad evidence behind quote any company that puts the owners on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own Peril Google avoided sanctions in this case it may not be so lucky in the next one entrepreneur and angel investor David Friedberg gives an interesting Viewpoint in his View the ruling is more anti- suuccess than it is anti-consumer I'll also say it just feels like the tenor of all of this is anti- success and not anti-competition and anything that's kind of successful or big is automatically deemed to be a monopoly and I think we really have to kind of understand how are consumers and the market for competition being affected by having all these things together and that's what should really be focused on and studied not just the fact that something is big and successful Jason kakanis another angel investor states that Google does not in fact have a monopoly on the ads business meta Amazon and Tik Tok are also huge players they do have a massive Monopoly in search that's absolutely true and the justice department I think is um well within their rights to to take a deep dive on that they don't have it in ads if you look at the competition for Google in advertising you got meta Tik Tok and Amazon which have very very significant advertising businesses and then like a bunch of new players um which are referred to basically as the shopping cart networks that's Uber instacart door Dash Etc and so when you look at this it really does rhyme with what happened with Microsoft they're two decades late on this the the search Monopoly has been squeezed for every dollar and to build every subcomponent of Google's Monopoly at the time of the antitrust ruling Google argued that its distribution deals are common in the business World they equated paying for search engine default privileges on phones to be the same as if a food manufacturer pays to promote products at ey level in a grocery store aisle the way Google sees it if you don't like Google you can switch the default engine on your device but people don't switch says Google because they prefer Google Google has also stated that they're going to appeal the decision of them being a monopoly on the flip side when it comes to the default status of Google and iPhones Apple themselves aren't a fan of Bing Eddie Q Apple's senior vice president said quote I don't believe there's a price in the world that Microsoft could offer us to set Bing as the default in Safari over Google they offered to give us Bing for free they could give us the whole company end quote but also take that with a grain of salt because it might be in Apple's best interest to defend Google it's actually written in that 20 billion contract with Google part of the contract obligates both Google and apple to defend this agreement quote in response to regulatory actions I.E doj antitrust lawsuits just like this one okay okay so that's the ruling but it doesn't leave you satisfied what does this all mean and what happens next and what about the calls to break up Google Justice Department officials are discussing their options including breaking up Google so that their Chrome browser could be sold as a separate company same with Google's Android smartphone operating system other options may include even separating YouTube from Google Department of Justice is considering breaking up Google after winning an antitrust case against the search giant just last week a hearing is said for early September you know maybe um forcing Google to divest the Android operating system and the Chrome browser those are two of the suggestions that we had heard from people with knowledge of this case even if you don't actually get a breakup it can divert resources Talent money uh Capital towards fighting these antitrust battles and make a company miss out on Innovation that led to what a l decade at Microsoft so that is the worry here for Google as well but the idea of a breakup has been raised that the doj is going to ask the judge to consider but there's a possibility that Google could even break itself up the last time something similar happened was back in 1982 When AT&T broke itself up and this was to dispel the antitrust pressure from the government Google has the opportunity to do something really interesting here which is get ahead of the curve and break itself up before the political system forces that onto it the big categories would be search advertising and YouTube and I think that would have two big economic benefits for shareholders one is you unlock value by deong glomera second once you break up the company into these pieces there's less places for employees who aren't doing anything to hide you know for all this bureaucracy to hide I mean look Google is famous for employees who don't do anything right the guys sitting on the roof suting themselves all day if you break up the company into three or four smaller companies right there's just way less room for people to the doj could also Force Google to make its advertising knowledge available to its Rivals but the most likely scenario is mandating that Google abandoned the deals with apple that made its search engine the default option and the same goes for the deal with Android manufacturers too law professor Spencer Weber Waller agrees quote there are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way more likely it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts exclusive contracts and Licensing restrictions that have reinforced its Monopoly position for years end quote now to the latest updates on September 6th 2024 in Washington a hearing was held by the doj the result of the hearing was that Google was going to be given an outline in December as to what they should do to restore competition in the market the prosecution hasn't finalized the details of the recommendation but justice department attorney David delist said that it should be sweeping the recommendations may include what we just covered but interestingly the doj is specifically looking at the intersection of artificial intelligence and Google's plans during the hearing there was lots of talk about Google's Gemini and what else Google had up their sleeve meanwhile Google said that they were concerned that the doj will hamstring their efforts in the next generation of search technology Google's Attorney John smed line said at the hearing that the company requires an in-depth proposal from the US government prosecutors he said that they need to know the details as soon as possible could also turn out that Google could reach out to Microsoft and open AI to come to their aid in regards to convincing the government that AI search isn't going to be dominated by Google after this around next August\n",

      "this video is brought to you by incog a northern California couple pleading guilty to a massive Ponzi scheme prosecutors say Jeff and pette kpof defrauded investors out of1 billion the stories of inventors are usually filled with inspiration and Ingenuity a story of humble and sometimes downright tragic circumstances that can turn around in the most majestic of ways at first glance this appears to be the story of Jeff kpof he was a 36-year-old jobless ex mechanic who lived in a rundown house with his wife and kids he was at Rock Bottom because all of his previous attempts to find Financial stability had failed but then out of desperation and sheer happen stance he invents a groundbreaking product or at least he thinks so anyway his invention gains incredible momentum and within a few short years he's transformed from being broke to a millionaire The Invention a mobile solar generator even without formal education investors poured Millions into his company even a US Bank and Warren Buffett's burky hathway got involved but beneath the surface it was all a scam in the end the scheme reached over $1 billion that's right billion with a be this is the story of Jeff kpo and how he orchestrated one of California's most significant frauds in its history you are watching T Fusion TV [Music] Jeff kof wouldn't be described as your typical Visionary he was an ordinary guy who enjoyed watching motor racing and baseball games his goals were simple make a decent living and provide a comfortable life for his family he grew up poor in the gritty town of Martinez California it was a bleak backdrop oil refineries billowed smoke and crime was rampant kpof would later describe the town as quote where the sewer meets the sea this description may have been a bit of a stretch but it captured the essence of the place from an early age Jeff learned to fend for himself and he dabbled in various odd jobs he floated around life on the edge of society brushes with addiction Petty crimes and Drug dealings were his early adult years his marriage to his high school girlfriend pette offered a glim of Hope together they started a successful Land Rover Repair shop this showcased Jeff's talent for fixing cars and attracting loyal customers however a disastrous business decision led to the Shop's closure in 2007 after that Financial desperation pushed him back to selling drugs again to make ends meet perhaps these early struggles set the stage for Jeff kof's Journey towards a fraudulent [Music] path Jeff now 36 years old had lost his business he had no money mounting debt and a mortgage to pay pedaling drugs forever was not a feasible option he needed a fresh start and he got one when he landed a job as a solar panel salesman he then realized something people were interested in solar but they were worried about their panels getting stolen and this gave him an idea what if he could make panels mobile and versatile he imagined hooking them up to a trailer that could be moved and parked anywhere having never gone to College Jeff kpof knew nothing about engineering ing but he was a skilled mechanic and he did like to Tinker with things so he drew up a plan on the back of a napkin and called in his car mechanic brother-in-law through trial and error they hacked together a Contraption with two rows of five solar panels mounted on a rotating beam the entire apparatus was constructed in a way that could be locked and tilted for easy transportation and sun exposure one could say that it was nothing special maybe even something a couple of Blockheads could have come up with but as fate would have it this tinker project would make history and well not in a good way meanwhile the portable generator Market was huge and growing it was worth nearly $3 billion a year the potential was massive although Jeff and his brother-in-law had no clue of this they didn't know how big the market was or even how to tap into it but as time wore on Jeff didn't think much of the initial idea at first however an old customer from back in his car shop days da Watson saw the potential Watson was a software consultant in the affluent Bay Area and he knew a thing or two about investment so he offered to help kpof and his wife start their company DC solar and it was to launch in 2008 by making solar mobile we've redefined energy independence with that we can provide solar light towers solar power electric vehicle charging stations the possibilities are endless at the same time Watson and his associates would handle marketing and this is where things really got cooking the initial plan of attack was to aim sales at Hollywood at the time movie sets were powered by noisy diesel generators portable solar panels could be a perfect quiet alternative the initial feedback was positive some big movies like Inception and Valentine's Day gave them a shot and the idea caught on even famous environmentalist actor Leonardo DiCaprio showcased the panels on his Facebook page it was the perfect organic promotion this was 2009 after all back then the public could basically lap up practically anything that a celebrity would [Music] endorse Jeff may not have been a Visionary but he understood the power of networking and he went all out from posing as a big shot entrepreneur to attending cocktail parties and even telling his Underdog personal story to win people over Jeff was just one of those guys who could talk his way into anything he would embellish stories and outright lie oh wow you saw saw shootings and stabbings growing up that's crazy that makes it even more amazing that you turned out to be such a brilliant entrepreneur but Jeff's mother would later tell the publication the Atlantic that Jeff always made stories up about his upbringing to make people feel sorry for him or just for a laugh his attempts paid off and he managed to make some important connections among top tier business professionals the most significant breakthrough came when kpof connected with a law firm called Nixon Peabody the firm was renowned for its expertise in getting special tax benefits for Industries including Renewable Power it was all falling into [Music] place the game-changing factor was that Congress tripled the value of investment tax credits in 2005 businesses could now get a whopping 30% of their federal income taxes back as a credit on any money they spent buying and installing solar equipment that means for every dollar spent they got 30 cents back from the government effectively an intrinsic 30% disc discount the DC solar trailers were a lucrative option for companies that just wanted to cut back on their tax bills and go green he set up a special fund that let buyers purchase the number of generators that align with the desired tax savings they only had to pay a 30% price UPF front and then take that exact amount off their taxes so basically they got their money back right away but what about the rest of the money DC solar promised to loan the remaining 70% to buyers the buyers would pay it back by leasing the generators on DC solar's behalf Jeff even guaranteed loan payments and offered cash payouts from the leasing Revenue it was an incredible deal for the companies on top of that they didn't have to worry about using maintaining or even laying eyes on their own generators as you're probably studying together these deals have very little to do with kof's product it was primarily based on exploiting the tax credit and the other perks that came with it that's why so many big companies fell for it the Allure of the benefits was so strong that parties often overlooked the necessity of comprehensive due diligence in all of this one crucial question was overlooked did the generator business model actually work well we'll soon find [Music] out it was March of 2011 and Jeff was attending a baseball game just as he was singing the National Anthem his phone buzzed with a text he had done it it was his first major deal the paint company Sherwin Williams Pur purchased 192 generators for $29 million he couldn't believe it the ball was really rolling now with this major deal Jeff's eyes were opened such a partnership could draw in more investors and not long after US Bank would join the party the bank believed that joining DC solar would align with its goals of promoting sustainability reducing tax and creating local jobs unfortunately for them they were unaware that Jeff had used fake documents and fraudulent transactions to inflate the demand for solar generators without verifying the facts the US Bank would become one of the First Financial backers for DC solar the plan was to purchase and Lease thousands of generators over the next 7 years despite the initial success questions began to appear about the real usefulness of Jeff's generators the lack of solar expertise was evident some movie sets began to experienced power outages due to faulty generators Jeff's brother-in-law Bobby Amo who was the builder of the Solar Generator products now called the solar eclipse would State quote I had no idea how solar worked good thing they had Google and all that end quote imagine using Google to build something that would net your company hundreds of millions of dollars the problems with the solar generators became so frequent that it wasn't uncommon for DC solar to use backup diesel generators to kick in after a power failure there would be smoke pouring from behind a solar generator the ultimate ironic imagery furthermore in preparation for the w L upcoming sale of equipment to Sheran Williams the paint company DC solar was to present their Fleet of panels a DC solar employee went to the production facility to see how things were going it wasn't good the clients were soon due to inspect the whole Fleet but only the first row of panels were complete the rest were just cobbled together to give the illusion that things were progressing faster than they actually were the employee pressed Jeff who remarked eh don't worry about it so was Jeff worried not really he was busy enjoying his new $1.3 million home paid in cash it had a pool and enough car space for six Vehicles a bigger problem was brewing however almost nobody wanted to lease these things for 5 to 10 years and without these long-term leases DC solar couldn't Finance the buyer's massive purchase loans or meet the demand for returns Additionally the IRS would prevent buyers from claiming solar tax credits if generators were left unused without those credits DC solar would lose its most appealing feature what on Earth was Jeff and his team going to do now faced with these challenges DC solar was financially toast but Jeff wasn't done yet he decided to get crafty a new idea emerged around June 2012 it was during a meeting between Jeff and two of his Close Associates at the company they devised a scheme to use the purchase money from new buyers to pay quote lease money to previous ones the trick was to manipulate accounting so that the companies cash from new generator sales appeared as lease payments from existing renters the whole plan seemed eerily like a classic Pony scheme but with an added layer DC solar didn't just defraud new buyers to pay off earlier ones it used the facade as a legitimate Solar Company to drain millions in tax credits from the US Treasury this meant that American taxpayers ended up subsidizing the fraud Jeff pitched it as a temporary measure just to make ends meet a typical fake it to you make it approach as we'll later see Jeff's lies began to spiral out of control and the disaster that was to follow was nothing short of [Music] Spectacular Now the problem for Jeff was he had to keep fooling more investors to keep the scheme going that's just the nature of a Ponzi scheme it relies on constantly bringing in money from new investors to pay off the old ones it's like building a house of cards with a small base and a very wide top so to maintain the illusion of success Jeff had to get get creative when prospective buyers inquired he'd say that his generators will lease to different customers the truth was he moved a few around to make it seem like there was demand he'd jack up their value and create fake lease agreements with madeup renters he even roped in a former IRS agent and a shell company to help close a $76 million deal now you might be wondering how did nobody catch on where were the authorities well the IRS did try to investigate in 2014 but DC solar's legal representative Forest milder took every step to suppress it at least for the time being some investors were getting suspicious at the time to mitigate the damage the team at DC solar had to become expert scammers remember barely anyone was leasing these things so there wasn't enough money coming in to make the payments to the old buyers the heat was being turned up and Jeff needed bigger clients Valley National Bank who was going to purchase $ 76.8 million of solar equipment asked for the list of companies renting out DC solar generators after all Jeff said over 80% of the generators were being rented out the truth was only 5% were and this was a problem in the end they deployed DC solar CFO Rob Carman a former alcoholic who couldn't hold a job and was only employed by the company because he was an old high school buddy of the accountant at DC solar robwood forg a bunch of documents and leasing figures to make the problem go away and the scam continued Fates would later catch DC solar but for now the coast was clear the participation of Geico which is a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's birkshire Hathaway added a massive layer of credibility the question is how did such an esteemed company get into the mix by Jeff lying to them of course Jeff wanted to play with the big players and to do that he needed to make his business seem even bigger so he CED up a fake lease deal agreement with the Telecom giant T-Mobile one of his henchmen got a T-Mobile employee on board by offering a huge salary and bonus all this employee had to do was sign some forged papers\n",

      "I have a business marketing degree but ended up with two retail jobs one that pays $10 an hour and the other with fewer shifts at $25 an hour I'm not making enough to get by I'm not going to have experienced this that most young adults do or did in the past because everything is just too expensive there's so much unknown I sometimes struggle to afford food despite working full-time and living with a roommate making ends meet means pulling money from savings skipping a meal or drinking water so that I can try and see full these individuals are from Generation z a generation who are coming of age right now a common reaction to the previous statements are as follows every generation has their own issues to deal with during their time and this new generation just simply needs to work harder while some could say that that's partially true it's clear that the numbers are not in favor of jenz when I first started Living on my own I was paying $280 a week in rent my landlord wanted to increase my rent now to $450 a week I make over three times the federal minimum wage and I cannot afford to live where does this go in 5 years when 100 million Americans cannot buy a home and get a fixed rate and their rents being raised 200 every year six in 10 genz ear feel unable to save for the future only 15% of gen Z expect to be able to afford a home in the next 5 years and 80% of those who rent worry that rental costs will keep Rising beyond their capacity to afford them 47% of gen Z report that they or a household member lost a job or took a pay cut due to the covid-19 pandemic and this makes them the most affected generation around 40% of gen Z are struggling with mental health with financial stress being a major factor so how did a generation that was poised for Success end up in such financial distress a gen Z really as lazy as many people claim or can we really blame this generation just think about it they had to live through multiple economic crises geopolitical tensions a global pandemic and a new constant fear of AI threatening to replace them and how do Millennials and Boomers play a part in all of this in this special episode we go through a journey of generations and we look at the real reasons why gen Z is facing the brunt of it all we'll tackle this topic in three broad categories housing the economy and education a quick note although this episode is focused on gen z a lot of this applies to younger Millennials too and a lot of these numbers are America focused but will definitely be including other countries around the world too so join us as we try to answer perhaps the most important question facing this generation is Gen Z truly the poorest generation in modern times you are watching cold fusion TV before we dive in let's paint a vivid picture of who we're talking about when we say genz at the time of writing the oldest of them would be around 27 years of age in America and Britain this group is 1/5 of the population a similar proportion to current Baby Boomers the developing world has more of them in Nigeria gen Z makes up 32% of the population and 27% for India in the west compared to Millennials gen Z are more environmentally conscious drink and smoke less and are in less relationships they care more about social issues although they socialize less 38 minutes per day versus an hour for the eth of the year 2000 you can watch my loneliness epidemic video for more on that side of things celebrities in this generation include the likes of Billy ish zanda Greta thunberg mbappe Mr Beast and Naomi Osaka while these genz celebrities are obviously doing fine everyday people in their cohort are coming of age into tough times what is really screwed up is the world is massively in debt the workforce is shrinking population's growth is slowing down it's slowing down GDP growth so there's not enough GDP growth to pay or service the amount of debt out there and what we found since 2008 that the answer to this debt issue has been printing of more money debasement of currency people think of it in terms of at first they think it's going to be inflation as in the price of CPI goes up but it's actually not it's actually something much worse is Wages don't rise but assets go up because optically you're debasing the currency but what's happening is you can't afford as much of that now and so your future self is in fact poorer so a classic example is a 35-year-old now in the United States getting married having kids a house is very expensive now compared to when Peter and I were young it was relative cheap three times incomes now it's like 10 times incomes so there's no real way of getting up the ladder so the advantages that your parents had are not available to you for Gen Z above all there's probably one thing that feels more Out Of Reach than anything else [Music] housing if you've scrolled through any social media feed you've likely come across memes like these this humor hits close to home for 34% of genz who see home ownership as an impossible feat in their lifetime not in the next 10 to 20 years but an entire lifetime think about that for a second additionally in 2022 the typical age for a first home buyer hit a record high 36 geners are staying at home longer to save on rent for example in the US young adults living at home have increased 87% over the last two decades and in Australia it's risen 177% just since 2016 in Sydney only 0.1% of the properties there are affordable for the average household for one student in Canada he found it cheaper to just fly to his classes to avoid higher rent I need to pay like 2500 for the rent I don't feel that is like you know viable the problem really becomes clear when you see the disparity visually in the US home prices are now Rising twice as fast as income now it takes about about 6 years of income to buy the average house for Boomers this was 2 to 3 years Generation X 3 to 4 years Millennials 4 to 5 years and as just shown gen Z 6 to 7 years but Australia is on another level the average house price in Sydney $1.6 million if you're on a single wage it takes 14 years of income on average to buy a house remember that's 14 years of work if you save 100% of everything you earn in other words you'd have to be homeless and eating out of garbage bins to do that just astonishing and then there's stories like this this three bedroom Padington home in Native renovation selling at auction for an ey watering $9 million that's a whole million and a half above the reserve boasting off street parking and a converted St the Terrace last sold in 1981 for $300,000 the new buyers are planning to spend anywhere from a million to 5 million to bring it up to scratch and this this split level one-bedroom apartment in Bondi Junction which is listed for $900 to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement among the applicants were two young Maids both male and wish to say Anonymous they were prepared to c-li in this one better these are the kind of sacrifices people are having to make there's a myriad of reasons of why this is happening in Australia and I'm going to do an entirely separate video on this topic alone but the bottom line is prices have surged more than 22% in just one year in the UK things are bad too the average house cost nine times as much as average earnings in the UK the last time house prices were this higher compared to earnings was almost 150 years ago back in 1876 but this is where things get a little more complicated there's actually a Twist here with Generation Z despite a global shortage in affordable housing and Rising property prices gen Z seems to be navigating the housing market adequately data from red fin over in the US shows that 30% of 25-year-olds owned homes in 2022 3% more than their Gen X counterparts at the same age well how is this here's what different experts say those in gen Z took advantage of record low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021 this made servicing a mortgage less of a burden gen Z has more remote work opportunities so they're able to live somewhere remote and more affordable and lastly this cohort has more access to technology information and platforms which all help in their home purchases according to Ben Miller the CEO of fundrise quote every generation is getting more economically screwed in some ways but they gen Z have way more knowledge and information than previous generations way way way more that's got to count for something end quote interestingly in comparison Millennials aren't doing so great with housing it seems like the 08 crisis hit that cohort hard when it came to buying a house on a societal level the problem of home ownership is making it harder for both younger Millennials and gen Z to think about marriage and having kids a solution that's equally as sad as it is dystopian is the tiny home Trend Jen zers and Millennials are buying pre-fabricated tiny homes on Amazon for under $40,000 as the median price of American homes tops $400,000 here in California the median house is over $770,000 a silver lining here is that reports suggest that the job market is booming or is it if you're 15 to 24 years old in some places you'd be lucky to have a job in Spain the unemployment rate of this age bracket is 28% Sri Lanka 27% Greece 25% Italy and Sweden 23% in China things also aren't going great for the young thanks to economic uncertainty and a large population in higher education over one-third of degree holders there may be unemployed let's go back to other parts of the world in the west the picture looks a lot better but as you'll soon see not all is as it seems youth unemployment across the Richer countries of the world on average is around 13% It hasn't been this low since 1991 but you might be thinking something doesn't feel right about this Rosy picture it's not like here jenzy and Millennials rejoicing about how good the job market is so what is going on why don't the figures line up with what everyone's feeling well the fact is the figures we often hear aren't telling us the full story for example in 1994 in the US the government changed the way they count unemployment they stopped counting all of those who stopped looking for work or only have part-time employment a lot of other countries have done this too and when you factor that in everything starts to make sense Peter Schiff explains further so if you're really want to put today's unemployment in context what you have to compare is the current U6 number to the u3 number that existed prior to 1994 and I happened to do that and what I found if you look at the 1950s and 1960s there wasn't a single year during those two decades where unemployment was as high as it is right now you got to go to the 1970s that was 1975 oh in 1976 so only 2 years and that's supposed to be a horrible decade stagflation Jimmy Carter all the bad stuff that happened there were only 3 years during the 1980s when unemployment was higher than it is right now we were in the worst recession since the Great Depression the FED had interest rates up at 20% right we were really trying to fight inflation so only during the latter 1970s and early 1980s did you have unemployment higher than it is right now so how is Gen Z doing today overall opinions are divided on the one hand Lawrence kotlov an economics professor at Boston University agrees that quote this is a tougher climate for sure parents need to realize that their kids are in trouble end quote others like personal finance expert Ken Coleman believe that gen Z has an advantage due to technology which levels the playing field quote I think this next Generation this gen Z generation and the kids coming up behind them I think we're going to see an entrepreneurial boom like we've never seen in history because of the playing field being leveled by technology making it so much easier end quote while it's true that technology does indeed help even the playing field will it be enough and it could be a double-edged sword for example AI advancements however hyped and overblown today in some areas could provide a real challenge to working humans over the next decade we'll have to wait and see okay so that was the job market but once genas get a job how are they doing well again again there's some interesting stuff going on gen Z have figured out something pretty smart changing jobs more often allows them to earn more almost 30% more according to Business Insider according to the economist the wages for Gen Z are rising much faster than other age groups in America hourly pay rates for those 16 to 24 were 7% higher year on-ear compared with workers aged 25 to 54 at 13% in Britain the pay of those age 18 to 21 Rose 15% last year and this is far greater than the other age groups in New Zealand the average hourly pay of those age 20 to 24 increased by 10% compared to the average of 6% in a few places including Croatia and Slovenia genz are already earning as much as the average worker it's all very interesting the explanation for this could be simple after the postco inflation started exploding a lot of people would ask for a raise and they got it but the difference would is this they're the youngest cohort so they had the lowest base wage because their wage was lower companies could afford to pay them more as it was still cheaper than retraining someone else for example so when you look at the proportions genz seems to be\n",

      "this video is brought to you by brilliant hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion when was the last time you used a CD or went to a physical music store remember flipping through the rows of shiny discs finding your favorite album or discovering something new unwrapping a new CD popping it into your player and hearing that crisp clean sound for the first time was a unique experience but when you think about it compact discs were actually pretty cool a laser scanning a spinning disc to read stored information delivering perfect quality music or files for something conceived in the 1970s compact discs were pretty futuristic of course with flash storage and now streaming and cloud storage those colorful discs are now the dinosaurs of Technology but what if I told you that CDs could still be the future incredibly researchers have made a breakthrough they've developed a 3D optical disc with a staggering 1.6 pits of storage capacity that's over 200,000 DV d s on a single disc so today we'll explore this incredible research and the unlikely Return of the compact disc how does it work will this ever see the light of day it is exciting but towards the end of the episode I'll get to the drawbacks as always but before all of that we'll take a fun trip down memory lane and delve briefly into the history of CDs it's quite an interesting story so let's jump into [Music] it you are watching C Fusion TV [Music] the CD's Journey began in the late 1970s when Phillips was working on video disc technology this was inspired by the emerging technology of lasers that could read data without contact research on video discs started all the way back in 1957 but it wasn't until the late '70s where Laser Technology became practical although it was ahead of its time the video disc project failed as the public ultimately weren't that interested I've done a full episode on laser discs if you're interested in that story but it wasn't the end Phillips saw an opportunity for using laser reading technology in the audio Market final records and tapes dominated at the time but they both had their limitations vinyl require delicate turntables prone to skipping while cassettes though portable and re-recordable lacked the character of vinyl audio and tended to degrade with repeated use Phillips aimed to create a smaller more portable disc that could hold at least an eror of music after years of research they developed audio longplay or Alp an audio disc system interestingly they initially considered quadrophonic sound an early form of surround sound but abandoned it due to size limitations the name compact disc was chosen to evoke the success of the compact cassette in March 1979 Phillips showcased the CD's audio quality however they lacked expertise in digital audio recording a crucial missing piece engineers at Phillips didn't know how to convert heard analog sound into digital that have to turn to Japan to solve that problem in Japan Sony was a master of digital audio circuitry with over a decade of experience refining the encoding of sound waves into digital signals however they lacked the expertise to create a physical compact disc this is where Phillips and Sony converged the result was genius Philips Engineers figured out how the laser could zoom past time etched pits etched into the disc surface and turned that into ones and zeros while Sony Specialists focused on the analog to digital circuitry also creating an error correcting code to maintain that pristine audio I remember reading about this in an encyclopedia when I was about 12 and I was amazed at how it worked anyway in 1980 Phillips and Sony produced The Red Book establishing all the standards for compact discs from then on they work separately on their own C equipment but agreed to share components in the early stages in April of 1982 Phillips introduced the first ever production CD player the initial CDs were made in a plant in Hanover Germany debut titles included Abba's album The Visitors and a recording of Herbert von karajan conducting Richard strauss's the Alpine Symphony in October of 1982 Sony CDP 101 made its debut in Japan Jaan alongside the first run of CD albums led by Billy Joel's 52nd Street Sony's device was pricey around $2,300 in today's currency initially us record labels were skeptical about CDs but one year later 1,000 different titles were available in time the audio quality began to speak for itself in 1985 di Strait's album brothers and arms became the first CD to sell over a million copies and it Remains the world's most successful CD album by 1988 400 million CDs were produced by 50 pressing plants worldwide in the year 2000 Global CD sales peaked at 2.45 billion between 2000 and 2007 CD sales nearly halfed to 1.75 five billion and this was mainly due to file sharing and MP3 players and we all know the story from here ultimately the rise of streaming services and changing consumer preferences led to the decline of CDs by 2021 CD sales had dropped by 95% since their Peak currently at their lowest levels since 1986 major artists like Adele Taylor Swift and BTS caused a brief Resurgence of CD sales in 2021 but the overall trend remains very downward and the fall of music CDs took CD ROMs and other forms of optical media with it so it's pretty much done that's it it's certain CDs once dominated but now they just occupy a nostalgic corner or do they well as mentioned at the top of this episode the life of the CD may not be over so I was thrilled to see this recent paper in nature about a new optical storage method that could bring dis memory into the petabyte range petabytes that's 1,000 terabytes imagine having to store around 6 billion web pages so if you store this massive amount of data on 1 terabyte hard drive the device will cover the area about the size of an average playground but with this new technology the same amount of data can be stored in the device the size of a desktop computer researchers at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology have developed a 3D optical disc with an astonishing capacity it can store up to 1.6 petabytes of data they published their study in nature and it's understandably caused a bit of a buzz so 1.6 pbits what is that that amount of data on a single optical disc is amazing but without context it's just a number so let's break it down let's compare it to the current champion of storage the exod drive Eed ct100 is currently the largest solid state drive available it offers a staggering 100 tab of storage capacity but the price well it's jaw-dropping $40,000 or $400 per terabyte and you thought Apple was bad but the thing is to put that into perspective a 100 terab is enough space for approximately 20 million songs 20,000 HD movies or 2,000 standard iPhones worth of data well that is a lot well this disc has even more capacity 1.6 pedits is equivalent to 200 terab or 200,000 GB the craziest thing is this new disc is about the same size as as a normal DVD but holds 4,000 times as much as a Blu-ray okay so you must be asking how did the researchers do it here's a simplified and brief explanation of it the secret behind this massive storage lies in layers traditional Optical discs like CDs or DVDs typically have one or two layers to store data sometimes they can go up to four but this new disc is like a skyscraper with 100 Floors each layer holding precious information by stacking these layers the researchers have crammed in more data than ever before next ultr transparent materials and nanoscale spots to achieve this feat they used Advanced Materials that allows light to pass through with minimal scattering now imagine tiny spots microscopic dots on each layer these spots are where the magic happens researchers created a new material called aggregation induced emission di doped photoresist or a i e ddpr for short it's a fancy and quite a mouthful of a term but think of these spots as data pixels the interesting thing here is that they're smaller than the wavelengths of visible light this was a limitation of traditional optical storage but now with this method they can record data in sections as small as 1/10th the wavelength of visible light this allows for the encoding of data on those 100 layers it's like writing with a super fine pen on an atomic scale so how do you write data onto this disc well it's like orchestrating a laser ballet a green laser triggers spot formation it's like a conductor raising the battern then a red laser steps in and switches off the writing process by controlling the timing they made the spots smaller than the waves of light themselves it's akin to Precision Machining with light on a nanoc scale to read the data they employed another laser Duo a blue beam makes the spots glow then an orange light turns off the glove and with that the data is revealed according to the researchers their disk with 100 layers spaced just a micrometer apart can read and write data very accurately to give you some imagery of the accuracy here's a demonstration of some layers being written on and remember the scale is 5 micromet but the journey to get here has been long and arduous Professor mingu who led the research explains how challenging it was over the last 10 years to find the perfect materials that could both handle reading and writing data in such a small space the plus side is manufacturing a disc is also easy it takes about 6 minutes per disc and it uses a similar method for those used in [Music] DVDs these new Ultra high-capacity discs are well suited for data centers these diss could enable data centers to store exabytes of data in a much smaller physical space than current Technologies think a billion gbits of storage in a room instead of a stadium also Optical discs are known for their longevity and durability so this makes them ideal for long-term archival storage they're portable and also robust against electromagnetic interference so this makes it suitable for safeguarding critical data but of course now the moment you've all been waiting for the downsides and limitations while the new Optical discs hold a lot of promise there are some severe limitations and challenges to consider so obviously there's market adoption apart from niche market segments like data storage and archival storage using physical media will be a tough sell everyone's already used to cloud storage and streaming services they're not going to want to give up their convenience physical media is just an extra step and added friction and next we come to one of the biggest issues current prototypes have major limitations in terms of writing speed and efficiency the estimated energy consumption would be in the kilowatt range per terabyte of writing and the right speed is only megabytes per second researchers are working on improving these aspects but who knows how long that's going to take and next next we have the cost a fosc laser similar to one of the ones used in the setup costs almost $50,000 and needs fans from an AC outlet now that is a showstopper if I've ever seen one lasers etching data on a nano scale really is amazing isn't it science as a whole is amazing but it can be overwhelming to understand well fortunately there's a fun and easy way to learn about it with brilliant.org brilliant

so in conclusion it seems like CDs wouldn't be making a comeback for the average consumer anytime soon but with such large amounts of storage in such a small medium there could be new uses for this technology perhaps data Sensers of the future we'll be using pedit CDs But ultimately realistically in the grand scheme of things research is research and for those of us interested in The Cutting Edge it's very cool to gwk over such Solutions but the reality is this will take many years to become a product if ever but I could be wrong and maybe the researchers will continue to refine the technology until it becomes commercially viable and the market responds positively but anyway what are your thoughts on this would you like to use such a beeroth of an optical disc format let me know in the comment section below so that is the story of the compact disc and its surprising possible fature okay so my name is toogo and you've been watching cold fusion and I'll catch you again soon for

      "this episode is brought to you by ground news hi welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion as reported by CNBC out of all the countries on Earth Vietnam will see the sharpest increase in wealth over the next decade why well it's because in the background they've been positioning themselves to become the new Global manufacturing Hub after China many companies are ramping up manufacturing efforts in Vietnam including Apple Samsung and Intel so what you might be thinking having the projected fastest growth in the next decade might be a nice achievement but what's the big deal well what makes this success story so incredible is that just in a single generation Vietnam went from one of the poorest nations in the world to a middle- inome economy to really understand how radical Vietnam's rise is you must comprehend its history the Perpetual struggle of war and how it all turned around for them in this episode we explore the emerging Dark Horse on the economic Global stage Vietnam we'll see their struggles and how this massive transformation took place and we'll also see the challenges that it yet has to overcome you are watching cold fusion [Music] TV so what comes to mind when you think about Vietnam for many younger people it might be a budget friendly Southeast Asian Gateway with stunning Landscapes but for those a bit older it might evoke images of a poor country with dense jungles soldiers trudging through thick foliage ravaged Villages and scenes of fleeing refugees a land of hardship and strife this imagery was largely influenced by mainstream Western media it was all over the news but also films like platoon and Full Metal Jacket portrayed the brutality of the Vietnam War but now in the mid 2020s this is simply a distant memory today the Lively streets of hoochi Min City Vietnam's largest Metropolis are filled with the buzz of motorbikes and aroma of street food and an energy of a Nation on the rise in the country's capital Hanoi skyscrapers Stand Tall high-tech industrial parks Buzz with activity and luxury Brands line the streets the city's Lively atmosphere can be felt there's young professionals everywhere and they're leading the charge creating everything from startups to sustainable agriculture the Boost in Economic Development has contributed to a significant rise in living standards but in Vietnam there's a saying Gua low guwan which in English Loosely translates to in hardship wisdom emerges and this couldn't be more fitting for the story we're about to tell Vietnam was under French colonial rule for nearly a century starting in the mid 19th century Vietnam became part of French Indochina Federation of French Colonial territories in Southeast Asia including Laos and Cambodia under French rule the country's resources were exploited for the benefit of the colonial power Vietnamese people faced har treatment forc labor and heavy taxation after nearly a century of Oppression resentment was quietly growing there was a strong desire for Independence among the Vietnamese people the desire had given rise to a revolutionary movement and it was led by hoochi Min he spent years abroad studying and rallying international support for Vietnam's cause he was an interesting character standing at 5'5 he wasn't physically intimidating and strangely he actually respected the Dem values of France but he thought that the French practicing colonialism was hypocritical although hii Min stated that he didn't like violence if anyone got in his way he would crush them later revered as the founding father of modern Vietnam hoi Min became the leader of the vietman a communist-led resistance group dedicated to ending colonial rule the Vietnamese were finally going to fight back there was an attempt for a peaceful resolution with the French but after peace talks broke down the struggle for Independence culminated in war in 1946 it was a war between hoi men's resistance Army and French forces the brutal conflict dragged on for nearly a decade France's control over Vietnam was heavily weakened after the second world war in 1954 the French were finally forced to negotiate the agreement was to split Vietnam in half the North and the South and this division would set the stage for the country's next chapter in history so now Vietnam was no longer under French rule but the road to reunification was far from smooth the peace was fragile and tensions between the Communist North led by hoochi Min and the anti-communist South quickly escalated the United States fearing a spread of Communism in Southeast Asia began to support the South Vietnamese government but the USA's full involvement only made matters worse these are US soldiers fighting on Vietnam's front lines they are giving their lives they are not just giving their advice to a degree Never foreseen by Kennedy we hold the destiny of Vietnam in our hands and it holds ours in essence the war was as much a battle of ideologies as it was a struggle for control from 1955 to 1975 Vietnam was engulfed in a brutal war that brought unimaginable suffering and destruction the American intervention marked by extensive bombing campaigns ground operations and millions of soldiers and total made headlines around the world the Youth of America protested against the war causing a social divide locally between Generations the war in Vietnam is no longer simply their War to win or lose it's ours as well and it has become the most divisive in a 100 Years of American History do the results match the effort student protests in 1970 at Kent State University saw a brutal Crackdown from the US National Guard resulting in the deaths of four students students the event shocked the world and this incident culturally later became known as the official end of the peace era of 1960s America the war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon the capital of South Vietnam after the fall Saigon was renamed hoi Min City in honor of the North Vietnamese leader finally the country was reunified under a socialist republic however the newly formed Vietnam faced a severe hardship the economy was en rued infrastructure was destroyed and agriculture crippled more than anything the war left an irreparable scar on the Vietnamese people Millions died Villages were burnt to the ground and families were torn apart the land was scarred by chemical defoliators the effects of which are still felt today the devastation of this war is well documented but I just want to give you an estimation on the level of Destruction about 1 to 3 million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians 300,000 cambodians 20,000 to 60,000 Lans and 58,000 US service members died in the conflict around 4.6 million tons of bombs were dropped on Vietnam it caused extensive damage to the countryside and infrastructure over the span of two decades a total of 3 million people from Laos Cambodia and Vietnam fled their countries according to the unhcr 800,000 of these refugees were Vietnamese who escaped by boat later to become known as the boat people of Vietnam so to recap Vietnam endured nearly a century under French colonial rule facing harsh treatment and exploitation hoi Min led the Revolutionary movement for Vietnamese Independence culminating in the first Indochina War a war with his resistance Army against the French in 1954 Vietnam achieved independence from French colonial rule the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975 involved a significant us participation the conflict ended with the reunification of the country under a socialist [Music] regime so after Decades of fighting and destruction Vietnam was left in ruins it was one of the poorest nations of the world the GDP per capita was hovering between $150 and $300 in the late 1980s to 1995 to give you an idea today in GDP per capita terms that would make it the second poorest country on on Earth ahead of Bundi and just below Afghanistan back then in Vietnam the struggle to rebuild was immense the path to recovery seemed daunting under a strict socialist system many refugees did return to their country and the streets of Hanoi and hoi Min City started to bustle with activity again yet the air was thick with the weight of economic despair the people in power knew that something needed to be done in December of 1986 the government introduced a policy called doy Moy the doy Mo reforms meaning renovation or innovation were born out of necessity and a desire for Renewal the initiative led by prime minister Nan Kong hon aimed to transition Vietnam from a command economy to a socialist oriented market economy the initial steps were cautious but significant everything was State controlled so in that context here are some key points and Milestones this reform achieved over time in the north leaders of Agriculture cooperatives who were respons ible for managing Collective farming efforts were now allowed to rent out land to individual Farmers this marked a shift away from strict government control Farmers gained more control over their plots allowing them to manage their own production and keep any surplus beyond their quotas this change revitalized agricultural output and boosted the rural economy provincial governments were given the freedom to create their own trading companies breaking the state's tight grip on foreign trade private markets for agricultural products emerged and price controls over consumer goods were lifted this allowed trade to flourish at market-driven prices the reforms extend far beyond agriculture the 1987 foreign investment law took manufacturing facilities out of the hands of the state and allowed foreign investors to establish businesses own property and make a profit at the same time domestic private Enterprises were encouraged to be established this led to a surge in domestic companies however the full potential potential of these reforms was initially hampered by a us trade embargo which had been in place since 1975 seemingly a Remnant from the Vietnam War but when the United States finally lifted the Embargo in 1994 the landscape of Vietnam's economy began to change [Music] dramatically among the first to recognize Vietnam's potential were Global Giants Nike and Adidas Nike set up a factory in Vietnam just one year after the Embargo lifted Adidas was soon to follow these companies saw an opportunity Vietnam had a favorable investment climate and a cheap labor force something which isn't always good and we'll get to that in a sec but right now Nike works with over 100 suppliers in Vietnam starting in the early 2000s Adidas began establishing multiple factories across Vietnam by 2021 Vietnam had become the country's largest sourcing country contributing to roughly 40% of its total Footwear production in 2021 Vietnam exported foot Ware to over 100 countries with production climbing to around 17.8 billion us today many Brands such as Zara and H&M have factories in Vietnam and there's $455 billion of total registered capital in the form of direct foreign investments into Vietnam there's almost 40,000 of these foreign investment companies and within those companies over 1,300 of them are fashion brands when factories open new jobs are created for the local Vietnam people in 20111 21% of employees were working in the industry and Manufacturing sector today this is over 33% there's also opportunities for high- skilled jobs such as managerial positions though of course it's not all sunshine and rainbows though sadly there are companies that use exploitative practices and diminish the rights of the workers but despite that in aggregate there has been upward Mobility for those in Vietnam between 1993 and 2014 Vietnam raised around 40 million people out of poverty during this period the poverty rate plummeted from nearly 60% to 14% but there's still much more to be done and we'll touch on that later today Vietnam's economy is growing up 5.8% while the global average is 2.9% so what's going on here well in Vietnam it's mix of smart trade policies Savvy domestic reforms and Hefty investments in infrastructure and human capital analysts from the World Bank and Brookings Institute suggest that there are three key factors driving Vietnam's continued economic growth let's take a closer look at these points number one trade agreements and liberalization Vietnam has strategically opened its Market through key trade agreements joining the Asian free trade area in 1995 a deal with the US in 2000 and joining the WTO in 20 2007 are notable examples since then Vietnam has secured trade agreements with China India Japan and Korea a 2018 trade deal with other countries like Australia New Zealand Malaysia Singapore Canada and Mexico and another trade deal with the EU in 2020 now joined the list these deals Poise Vietnam to be a future export Powerhouse number two domestic reforms Vietnam has complemented its external openness with some crucial domestic reforms these include deregulation and an effort to reduce the cost of doing business red tape and hassle are being minimized as a result in 2023 alone Vietnam attracted nearly $ 36.6 billion in foreign direct investment okay so what does that mean well it's extremely significant because that's a 32.1% increase from just the previous year it's an absolute rocket ship but in saying that there's also the point of appearing tough on corruption it's a point which we talked about with the case of trong Myan after bribing everyone and stealing 3% of the nation's GDP she was sentenced to death it's a signal that Vietnam is getting serious even if it is just on the surface okay number three investing in capital with a population of 35 million half of whom are under 35 Vietnam has prioritized Public Funding for primary education and infrastructure it seems like they know the value of an educated and young Workforce Vietnam has always been an export heavy country its economy was once rooted in agriculture they had exports like wet rice coffee and black pepper but from 2008 to 2018 agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined as the industrial sector took off today it might surprise a lot of people but Vietnam stands out as a major player in the technology Hardware space in 2023 they exported 57.3 billion dollars worth of electronic devices computers and parts globally the country now ranks seventh in electronics exports this highlights a rapid change there's a growing presence of Global Tech companies such as Samsung Apple Intel and foxcon in Vietnam in fact such companies are flocking to the country eager to invest in and capitalize on its booming Market let's take a look at a few examples Samsung the company produces about half of its smartphones in Vietnam they're planning to boost investment from 18 billion to 20 billion in the near future since 2019 Apple's total Investments have exceeded 16 billion creating over 200,000 jobs in Vietnam and Tim Cook is investing heavily in Vietnam analysts forecast that by 20125\n",

      "we can say what we want about the F35 but the Martin Becker MK16 seat works extremely well and for the 11th loss of an F35 it once again saved its pilot even if the plane it must be said is apparently not go far these images are absolutely incredible and inevitably they make you think a little bit so I reassure you right away even if at the moment we cannot know precisely what happened and we do not have the knowledge the Americans are going to make investigations and one of these investigations the one led by the jag you perhaps remember from the series on TV will allow us within 1 year or 2 years to see a little more clearly on who is responsible for the loss of this plane worth several tens of millions of dollars why am I specifying this legal part because the safety investigation the feedback from operational experience the lon Len as the Americans say will probably never be published in open source and that is a shame, that’s why I’m still offering you to try to understand what could have brought this F35 into this situation given the information we have on this Wednesday January 29 at 12:51 p.m. go jingle [Music] on Tuesday January 28 around 1 p.m. local time an F35a crashed had declared a breakdown and he was returning to the field we do not know the precise nature of the breakdown all this took place in Alaska on the side of the large base of Elson Air Force Base which was manufactured in 1943 which was initially called m 26 satellite field because located 26 miles 42 km southeast of Fairbanks and which was renamed in 1948 with this name in homage to a pilot of the Great North American small point namely this base houses the 354th Fighter Wing they belong to the Pacific Air Force and it is there that the famous Red Flag Alaska exercises are organized which generally take place four times a year for around ten days. F16s you have F35as and you also have C135s the tankers this base was in decline and it was saved if I may say by the F35s they received their first in 2020 and now you have more than fifty F35s with approximately 3,500 personnel on this base an increase of more than 50% for personnel with the arrival of the F35 this base also participates in the protection of the airspace of North America the famous Norade and that is why there are also tankur to give the necessary extension because I remind you between Alaska and Russia there are only a few tens of kilometers in the radio exchanges that have been published online you hear wide 27 who is a tanker who is told to standby at 6000 feet because the broncho patrol at IFI IFE iNight Emer if they have a breakdown and will not let you don't be surprised that these conversations leak onto the Internet because they take place on UHF frequencies and many fans listen to all this live, it's legal and when clarmé doesn't want it to be heard he goes on secure frequencies we have for example a half quick system which does frequency evasion where you can have crypto or even communicate for example with link 16 you can talk to each other via what is called gvoice link 16 allows you to communicate between planes there we are on classic UHF these planes are also equipped with VHF for the record the Lig planes speak VHF the military rather in UHF so before going into the detail of the analysis of the images what I am offering you is an extremely refreshing quick on the F35 three small medium version technical memo so you don't get lost ABC AC airfield or aerodrome it's the Air Force version the one that was lost today B it's boat a boat a aircraft takeoff carrier vertical landing which is used for example by the marines and the third the C is like a carrier aircraft carrier catapult stopping strand A BC an airfield B boat vertical and C carrier with the Cross and enough to be catapulted by the catapult more of 1000 F35s of all different versions built first flight in 2006 but really operational for version a in the R force from 2016 and we are on a big baby 13 tons with almost 32 tons in mass a Rafale is 24 ton5 big specificity of the F35 its stealth and recently in the French press it was mentioned that the burst pilots of the The Air Force had difficulty facing stealth aircraft necessarily at long distance if you do not detect your adversary it is complicated however what is certain is that in close combat the F35 is not made for that the whole difficulty is managing to survive until the close combat we are going to come back a little bit on the accidentology of the F35s and to be precise of the ones in 2014 there was one who had taken fire on the ground at the Glin base in Florida due to a problem with the reactor they had stopped the fleet for around ten days and subsequently had made modifications to the F35 reactor in 2019 in April 2019 it is a Japanese pilot who announces the end of the fight because he is not well and who finds himself in a sensory illusion this is the official reason and hits the sea without trying to eject the air force unfortunately lost a pilot in the same conditions with the arrival of the Rafal at night in October 2019 it's funny to celebrate the arrival in the Netherlands of an F35 the firefighters welcomed it with cannons foam and it has grounded from the plane for 3 months in May 2020 still in Eglin normal there are many there a pilot who had his helmet which was incorrectly adjusted helmet where you have all the flight information ends up with fatigue and a flight control problem having to eject because he can no longer control his plane during landing we talked about it on the channel and in 2022 it is in South Korea an F35 after hearing a strange noise during THE flight only finds itself able to control the plane and the reactor and is forced to land with its gear retracted on the runway in Korea to finish we also spoke on the channel an F35 had a kill on another F35 in October 2022 in because of its wake turbulence the pilots had not respected the regulations on spacing and an F35 found itself in the wake turbulence losing control and had not been able to catch up the plane had been forced to eject that it's for the f35a so if we look a little bit at the philosophy we tend to see that there is still a little bit of human factor but that otherwise it's more problems that come from the machine and still it must be said about on-board computing if you are on an old generation aircraft and speak you put the stick to the left in Super Étendard the super éendard will go to the left you have a direct connection these 5th generation aircraft but even generation 4.5 you give an instruction is an electrical signal which goes into the computer, the aatic computer which looks at all these sensors and which will decide, given the macro situation, how they will move the flight controls to put it simply without computers you do not control the plane with a big computer problem you cannot go live to a 737 you can go live to Cesna you are live to an airplane like the F35 computer problem equals big problem and there what we knows it's that the plane is returning due to a breakdown what we also see in the images look at ha on the left is that he is accompanied there is another fighter probably F35 which accompanies him the fighters rarely leave alone in flight it's a training mission there were two of them and they were on the return what we also see is that the gear was out so when you come back broken down generally what you do you are with two planes depending on the nature of the breakdown there he had the weather looks good either the wounded bird the injured plane is in the lead and the other plane accompanies it and monitors it or the weather is not nice and you have problems on board the plane which is healthy is in the lead and you try to follow it in the clouds until you manage to acquire a view of the runway in general when you are the injured plane if the weather is good you prefer to have the liad and to be accompanied rather than having to manage your plane which has a problem to maintain anti-collision in relation to your leader so in a case like that it is likely to think that the plane which has the problem was in head accompanied by his colleague about a hundred meters away who ensures that the parameters are good and can even in which a slightly electronic plane like that remind him of the parameters we are at 1500 feet 200 knot we are at 1300 feet 190 knots we are at 1000 feet 180 knots take out your gear and so on and accompany it like that until the landing while reducing its workload by managing, for example, communications with the control tower, this allows you as plane broken down to focus on managing your machine because you are alone to manage everything and well that still takes a little bit of bandwidth and sometimes you have to take out a little checklist now what we see it's very interesting is that the pilot is under canopy and his plane is higher than him we agree it's not trivial what this can make you think it can make you think of a phase where the plane is no longer controllable as it begins to go upwards the pilot decides to exit finds himself ejected under canopy and there after the plane continues to climb loses its speed and descends it is a possibility now look at this distance between the trajectory of the parachute and the plane it’s still necessary to say it is not banal the other possibility would be that a plane is about to fall and you get out but in this case you are above the wreckage so clearly it is that the plane after ejection is mounted what we have already seen in the history of fighter aviation is that following the ejection this creates torques at the level of the plane and this changes its trajectory you are in horizontal volrecting you eject yourself it creates a couple the plane changes trajectory perhaps goes up and comes down unlikely but why not we know that on F35B we had the case of a plane which flew 10 minutes after the ejection of its pilot in horizontal flight we talked about it on the channel also small point of detail you see the pilot under his parachute you see that he has nothing underneath him so normally when you eject if you have time you check that your canopy will unclip you your snout you check that everything is going well you are not injured and then you come and remove your survival pact which is often hung under your buttocks why do you do that because it weighs you down and because when you fly for example above the water you have a dingy you have a canoe you have survival gear and if you release it it hangs about 6 m below you and when you reach the ground it hits the ground so it actually reduces the mass that you have and it will reduce your C drop a little bit there we can still see that under sail well it hits hard especially on frozen ground so the pilot is fine he is in stable condition the Americans reacted in a very professional manner compared to in this accident they were very transparent they explained what he had to explain they said the pilot ejected at the end of a training flight on the perimeter of the base they ask people not to stop to not take photos because it is forbidden to take photos on the base and there that brings us another lesson each time there is an F35 crash we will be precise 80% of the times where there is an F35 crash we have the images that come out and there these images come to us directly from the base they have an operational security problem the Americans like many other nations have this cultural problem that we see something we film we put it on the networks this is not normally compatible with the ethics and regulations on its military bases so it is more than likely that the person filming risks being pursued by the Americans because even if it's nice it gives us something to debrief from what to analyze what to share around the air trying to learn from it well it's not supposed to happen like that why do I insist on it because in each event we see each time that it is become a reflex among people I film I put on the internet there was the same case during the crash of the F35B on the British aircraft carrier the images were released while it was on an aircraft carrier and in the case of the loss of the F35C on the carries the American aircraft carrier the same it did not have to leave the aircraft carrier and very interesting to realize that in fact this type of accident did not necessarily exist in older generation aircraft where you could almost whatever happens maintain control of your plane even when there is no engine so these new planes have Achile heels when everything is working well they are extremely efficient planes when you start to have certain computer problems certain certain types of problems which come and press on your achiles heel we have what we call in the navy the cliff effect a huge loss of operational efficiency which can lead the pilot to eject fortunately the ejector works well Martin Becker has already shared the fact that he had just saved another F35 pilot now do not rush to criticize the F35 it is an aircraft which has proven itself in combat which has proven itself in RR which has its field of employment and its doctrine of employment and\n",
